and to them were given seven trumpets.234 - Revelation 8:3     And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne.235 - Revelation 8:4     And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand.236 - Revelation 8:5     And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast it into the earth: and there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake.237 - Revelation 8:6     And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.238 - Revelation 8:7     The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.239 - Revelation 8:8     And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood;240 - Revelation 8:10     And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters;241 - Revelation 8:12     And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars;
