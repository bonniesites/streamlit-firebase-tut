1 - 2 Samuel 5:14     And these be the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,2 - 2 Samuel 12:24     And David comforted Bath-sheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the Lord loved him.3 - 1 Kings 1:10     But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not.4 - 1 Kings 1:11     Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign, and David our lord knoweth it not?5 - 1 Kings 1:12     Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon.6 - 1 Kings 1:13     Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign?7 - 1 Kings 1:17     And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by the Lord thy God unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.8 - 1 Kings 1:19     And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy servant hath he not called.9 - 1 Kings 1:21     Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.10 - 1 Kings 1:26     But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called.11 - 1 Kings 1:30     Even as I sware unto thee by the Lord God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day.12 - 1 Kings 1:33     The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:13 - 1 Kings 1:34     And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon.14 - 1 Kings 1:37     As the Lord hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.15 - 1 Kings 1:38     So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon.16 - 1 Kings 1:39     And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon.17 - 1 Kings 1:43     And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king.18 - 1 Kings 1:46     And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.19 - 1 Kings 1:47     And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed.20 - 1 Kings 1:50     And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.21 - 1 Kings 1:51     And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me to day that he will not slay his servant with the sword.22 - 1 Kings 1:52     And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die.23 - 1 Kings 1:53     So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said unto him, Go to thine house.24 - 1 Kings 2:1     Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying,25 - 1 Kings 2:12     Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly.26 - 1 Kings 2:13     And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.27 - 1 Kings 2:17     And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for he will not say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife.28 - 1 Kings 2:19     Bath-sheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand.29 - 1 Kings 2:22     And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.30 - 1 Kings 2:23     Then king Solomon sware by the Lord, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life.31 - 1 Kings 2:25     And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died.32 - 1 Kings 2:27     So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the Lord; that he might fulfil the word of the Lord, which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.33 - 1 Kings 2:29     And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the Lord; and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.34 - 1 Kings 2:41     And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again.35 - 1 Kings 2:45     And king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the Lord for ever.36 - 1 Kings 2:46     So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.37 - 1 Kings 3:1     And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the Lord, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.38 - 1 Kings 3:3     And Solomon loved the Lord, walking in the statutes of David his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places.39 - 1 Kings 3:4     And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar.40 - 1 Kings 3:5     In Gibeon the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream by night: and God said, Ask what I shall give thee.41 - 1 Kings 3:6     And Solomon said, Thou hast shewed unto thy servant David my father great mercy, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day.42 - 1 Kings 3:10     And the speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing.43 - 1 Kings 3:15     And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream. And he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.44 - 1 Kings 4:1     So king Solomon was king over all Israel.45 - 1 Kings 4:7     And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, which provided victuals for the king and his household: each man his month in a year made provision.46 - 1 Kings 4:11     The son of Abinadab, in all the region of Dor; which had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife:47 - 1 Kings 4:15     Ahimaaz was in Naphtali; he also took Basmath the daughter of Solomon to wife:48 - 1 Kings 4:21     And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life.49 - 1 Kings 4:22     And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal,50 - 1 Kings 4:25     And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon.51 - 1 Kings 4:26     And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.52 - 1 Kings 4:27     And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all that came unto king Solomon's table, every man in his month: they lacked nothing.53 - 1 Kings 4:29     And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore.54 - 1 Kings 4:30     And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt.55 - 1 Kings 4:34     And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom.56 - 1 Kings 5:1     And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David.57 - 1 Kings 5:2     And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,58 - 1 Kings 5:7     And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be the Lord this day, which hath given unto David a wise son over this great people.59 - 1 Kings 5:8     And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things which thou sentest to me for: and I will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.60 - 1 Kings 5:10     So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all his desire.61 - 1 Kings 5:11     And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year.62 - 1 Kings 5:12     And the Lord gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together.63 - 1 Kings 5:13     And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men.64 - 1 Kings 5:15     And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens, and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains;65 - 1 Kings 5:16     Beside the chief of Solomon's officers which were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, which ruled over the people that wrought in the work.66 - 1 Kings 5:18     And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders did hew them, and the stonesquarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house.67 - 1 Kings 6:1     And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the Lord.68 - 1 Kings 6:2     And the house which king Solomon built for the Lord, the length thereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits.69 - 1 Kings 6:11     And the word of the Lord came to Solomon, saying,70 - 1 Kings 6:14     So Solomon built the house, and finished it.71 - 1 Kings 6:21     So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold.72 - 1 Kings 7:1     But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house.73 - 1 Kings 7:8     And his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch, which was of the like work. Solomon made also an house for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he had taken to wife, like unto this porch.74 - 1 Kings 7:13     And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.75 - 1 Kings 7:14     He was a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and cunning to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work.76 - 1 Kings 7:40     And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the house of the Lord:77 - 1 Kings 7:45     And the pots, and the shovels, and the basins: and all these vessels, which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the Lord, were of bright brass.78 - 1 Kings 7:47     And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were exceeding many: neither was the weight of the brass found out.79 - 1 Kings 7:48     And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of the Lord: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the shewbread was,80 - 1 Kings 7:51     So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the Lord. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated; even the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, did he put among the treasures of the house of the Lord.81 - 1 Kings 8:1     Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the city of David, which is Zion.82 - 1 Kings 8:2     And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.83 - 1 Kings 8:5     And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude.84 - 1 Kings 8:12     Then spake Solomon, The Lord said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.85 - 1 Kings 8:22     And Solomon stood before the altar of the Lord in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven:86 - 1 Kings 8:54     And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the Lord, he arose from before the altar of the Lord, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven.87 - 1 Kings 8:63     And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered unto the Lord, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the Lord.88 - 1 Kings 8:65     And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt, before the Lord our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days.89 - 1 Kings 9:1     And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the house of the Lord, and the king's house, and all Solomon's desire which he was pleased to do,90 - 1 Kings 9:2     That the Lord appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had appeared unto him at Gibeon.91 - 1 Kings 9:10     And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the Lord, and the king's house,92 - 1 Kings 9:11     (Now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire,) that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.93 - 1 Kings 9:12     And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him; and they pleased him not.94 - 1 Kings 9:15     And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised; for to build the house of the Lord, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.95 - 1 Kings 9:16     For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and given it for a present unto his daughter, Solomon's wife.96 - 1 Kings 9:17     And Solomon built Gezer, and Beth-horon the nether,97 - 1 Kings 9:19     And all the cities of store that Solomon had, and cities for his chariots, and cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.98 - 1 Kings 9:21     Their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, upon those did Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day.99 - 1 Kings 9:22     But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen: but they were men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen.100 - 1 Kings 9:23     These were the chief of the officers that were over Solomon's work, five hundred and fifty, which bare rule over the people that wrought in the work.101 - 1 Kings 9:24     But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David unto her house which Solomon had built for her: then did he build Millo.102 - 1 Kings 9:25     And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the Lord, and he burnt incense upon the altar that was before the Lord. So he finished the house.103 - 1 Kings 9:26     And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion-geber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of Edom.104 - 1 Kings 9:27     And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.105 - 1 Kings 9:28     And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.106 - 1 Kings 10:1     And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the Lord, she came to prove him with hard questions.107 - 1 Kings 10:2     And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.108 - 1 Kings 10:3     And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not any thing hid from the king, which he told her not.109 - 1 Kings 10:4     And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon's wisdom, and the house that he had built,110 - 1 Kings 10:10     And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.111 - 1 Kings 10:13     And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants.112 - 1 Kings 10:14     Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold,113 - 1 Kings 10:16     And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of gold went to one target.114 - 1 Kings 10:21     And all king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; none were of silver: it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.115 - 1 Kings 10:23     So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom.116 - 1 Kings 10:24     And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.117 - 1 Kings 10:26     And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king at Jerusalem.118 - 1 Kings 10:28     And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.119 - 1 Kings 11:1     But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and Hittites;120 - 1 Kings 11:2     Of the nations concerning which the Lord said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall not go in to them, neither shall they come in unto you: for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods: Solomon clave unto these in love.121 - 1 Kings 11:4     For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God, as was the heart of David his father.122 - 1 Kings 11:5     For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.123 - 1 Kings 11:6     And Solomon did evil in the sight of the Lord, and went not fully after the Lord, as did David his father.124 - 1 Kings 11:7     Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon.125 - 1 Kings 11:9     And the Lord was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned from the Lord God of Israel, which had appeared unto him twice,126 - 1 Kings 11:11     Wherefore the Lord said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant.127 - 1 Kings 11:14     And the Lord stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he was of the king's seed in Edom.128 - 1 Kings 11:25     And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, beside the mischief that Hadad did: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.129 - 1 Kings 11:26     And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, Solomon's servant, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow woman, even he lifted up his hand against the king.130 - 1 Kings 11:27     And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breaches of the city of David his father.131 - 1 Kings 11:28     And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour: and Solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph.132 - 1 Kings 11:31     And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces: for thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee:133 - 1 Kings 11:40     Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.134 - 1 Kings 11:41     And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?135 - 1 Kings 11:42     And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.136 - 1 Kings 11:43     And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.137 - 1 Kings 12:2     And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was yet in Egypt, heard of it, (for he was fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;)138 - 1 Kings 12:6     And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise that I may answer this people?139 - 1 Kings 12:21     And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.140 - 1 Kings 12:23     Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people, saying,141 - 1 Kings 14:21     And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the Lord did choose out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess.142 - 1 Kings 14:26     And he took away the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king's house; he even took away all: and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made.143 - 2 Kings 21:7     And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the house, of which the Lord said to David, and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:144 - 2 Kings 23:13     And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had builded for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile.145 - 2 Kings 24:13     And he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king's house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the Lord, as the Lord had said.146 - 2 Kings 25:16     The two pillars, one sea, and the bases which Solomon had made for the house of the Lord; the brass of all these vessels was without weight.147 - 1 Chronicles 3:5     And these were born unto him in Jerusalem; Shimea, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon, four, of Bath-shua the daughter of Ammiel:148 - 1 Chronicles 3:10     And Solomon's son was Rehoboam, Abia his son, Asa his son, Jehoshaphat his son,149 - 1 Chronicles 6:10     And Johanan begat Azariah, (he it is that executed the priest's office in the temple that Solomon built in Jerusalem:)150 - 1 Chronicles 6:32     And they ministered before the dwelling place of the tabernacle of the congregation with singing, until Solomon had built the house of the Lord in Jerusalem: and then they waited on their office according to their order.151 - 1 Chronicles 14:4     Now these are the names of his children which he had in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,152 - 1 Chronicles 18:8     Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, brought David very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.153 - 1 Chronicles 22:5     And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be builded for the Lord must be exceeding magnifical, of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I will therefore now make preparation for it. So David prepared abundantly before his death.154 - 1 Chronicles 22:6     Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build an house for the Lord God of Israel.155 - 1 Chronicles 22:7     And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build an house unto the name of the Lord my God:156 - 1 Chronicles 22:9     Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days.157 - 1 Chronicles 22:17     David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying,158 - 1 Chronicles 23:1     So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son king over Israel.159 - 1 Chronicles 28:5     And of all my sons, (for the Lord hath given me many sons,) he hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the Lord over Israel.160 - 1 Chronicles 28:6     And he said unto me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house and my courts: for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father.161 - 1 Chronicles 28:9     And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind: for the Lord searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts: if thou seek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever.162 - 1 Chronicles 28:11     Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch, and of the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and of the upper chambers thereof, and of the inner parlours thereof, and of the place of the mercy seat,163 - 1 Chronicles 28:20     And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good courage, and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed: for the Lord God, even my God, will be with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee, until thou hast finished all the work for the service of the house of the Lord.164 - 1 Chronicles 29:1     Furthermore David the king said unto all the congregation, Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is great: for the palace is not for man, but for the Lord God.165 - 1 Chronicles 29:19     And give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for the which I have made provision.166 - 1 Chronicles 29:22     And did eat and drink before the Lord on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him unto the Lord to be the chief governor, and Zadok to be priest.167 - 1 Chronicles 29:23     Then Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.168 - 1 Chronicles 29:24     And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king.169 - 1 Chronicles 29:25     And the Lord magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.170 - 1 Chronicles 29:28     And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honour: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.171 - 2 Chronicles 1:1     And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the Lord his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly.172 - 2 Chronicles 1:2     Then Solomon spake unto all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every governor in all Israel, the chief of the fathers.173 - 2 Chronicles 1:3     So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the Lord had made in the wilderness.174 - 2 Chronicles 1:5     Moreover the brasen altar, that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the Lord: and Solomon and the congregation sought unto it.175 - 2 Chronicles 1:6     And Solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the Lord, which was at the tabernacle of the congregation, and offered a thousand burnt offerings upon it.176 - 2 Chronicles 1:7     In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him, Ask what I shall give thee.177 - 2 Chronicles 1:8     And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast shewed great mercy unto David my father, and hast made me to reign in his stead.178 - 2 Chronicles 1:11     And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of thine enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king:179 - 2 Chronicles 1:13     Then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tabernacle of the congregation, and reigned over Israel.180 - 2 Chronicles 1:14     And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, which he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.181 - 2 Chronicles 1:16     And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.182 - 2 Chronicles 2:1     And Solomon determined to build an house for the name of the Lord, and an house for his kingdom.183 - 2 Chronicles 2:2     And Solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand to hew in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them.184 - 2 Chronicles 2:3     And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou didst deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to build him an house to dwell therein, even so deal with me.185 - 2 Chronicles 2:11     Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, Because the Lord hath loved his people, he hath made thee king over them.186 - 2 Chronicles 2:17     And Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of Israel, after the numbering wherewith David his father had numbered them; and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred.187 - 2 Chronicles 3:1     Then Solomon began to build the house of the Lord at Jerusalem in mount Moriah, where the Lord appeared unto David his father, in the place that David had prepared in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.188 - 2 Chronicles 3:3     Now these are the things wherein Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first measure was threescore cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.189 - 2 Chronicles 4:11     And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basins. And Huram finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon for the house of God;190 - 2 Chronicles 4:16     The pots also, and the shovels, and the fleshhooks, and all their instruments, did Huram his father make to king Solomon for the house of the Lord of bright brass.191 - 2 Chronicles 4:18     Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for the weight of the brass could not be found out.192 - 2 Chronicles 4:19     And Solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of God, the golden altar also, and the tables whereon the shewbread was set;193 - 2 Chronicles 5:1     Thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the Lord was finished: and Solomon brought in all the things that David his father had dedicated; and the silver, and the gold, and all the instruments, put he among the treasures of the house of God.194 - 2 Chronicles 5:2     Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the city of David, which is Zion.195 - 2 Chronicles 5:6     Also king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that were assembled unto him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and oxen, which could not be told nor numbered for multitude.196 - 2 Chronicles 6:1     Then said Solomon, The Lord hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.197 - 2 Chronicles 6:13     For Solomon had made a brasen scaffold, of five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court: and upon it he stood, and kneeled down upon his knees before all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven,198 - 2 Chronicles 7:1     Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of the Lord filled the house.199 - 2 Chronicles 7:5     And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep: so the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.200 - 2 Chronicles 7:7     Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of the Lord: for there he offered burnt offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the brasen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings, and the meat offerings, and the fat.201 - 2 Chronicles 7:8     Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt.202 - 2 Chronicles 7:10     And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away into their tents, glad and merry in heart for the goodness that the Lord had shewed unto David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people.203 - 2 Chronicles 7:11     Thus Solomon finished the house of the Lord, and the king's house: and all that came into Solomon's heart to make in the house of the Lord, and in his own house, he prosperously effected.204 - 2 Chronicles 7:12     And the Lord appeared to Solomon by night, and said unto him, I have heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place to myself for an house of sacrifice.205 - 2 Chronicles 8:1     And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon had built the house of the Lord, and his own house,206 - 2 Chronicles 8:2     That the cities which Huram had restored to Solomon, Solomon built them, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there.207 - 2 Chronicles 8:3     And Solomon went to Hamath-zobah, and prevailed against it.208 - 2 Chronicles 8:6     And Baalath, and all the store cities that Solomon had, and all the chariot cities, and the cities of the horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and throughout all the land of his dominion.209 - 2 Chronicles 8:8     But of their children, who were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel consumed not, them did Solomon make to pay tribute until this day.210 - 2 Chronicles 8:9     But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his work; but they were men of war, and chief of his captains, and captains of his chariots and horsemen.211 - 2 Chronicles 8:10     And these were the chief of king Solomon's officers, even two hundred and fifty, that bare rule over the people.212 - 2 Chronicles 8:11     And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of David unto the house that he had built for her: for he said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the places are holy, whereunto the ark of the Lord hath come.213 - 2 Chronicles 8:12     Then Solomon offered burnt offerings unto the Lord on the altar of the Lord, which he had built before the porch,214 - 2 Chronicles 8:16     Now all the work of Solomon was prepared unto the day of the foundation of the house of the Lord, and until it was finished. So the house of the Lord was perfected.215 - 2 Chronicles 8:17     Then went Solomon to Ezion-geber, and to Eloth, at the sea side in the land of Edom.216 - 2 Chronicles 8:18     And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships, and servants that had knowledge of the sea; and they went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and took thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon.217 - 2 Chronicles 9:1     And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great company, and camels that bare spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.218 - 2 Chronicles 9:2     And Solomon told her all her questions: and there was nothing hid from Solomon which he told her not.219 - 2 Chronicles 9:3     And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,220 - 2 Chronicles 9:9     And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices great abundance, and precious stones: neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave king Solomon.221 - 2 Chronicles 9:10     And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, which brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and precious stones.222 - 2 Chronicles 9:12     And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside that which she had brought unto the king. So she turned, and went away to her own land, she and her servants.223 - 2 Chronicles 9:13     Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold;224 - 2 Chronicles 9:14     Beside that which chapmen and merchants brought. And all the kings of Arabia and governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon.225 - 2 Chronicles 9:15     And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one target.226 - 2 Chronicles 9:20     And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold: none were of silver; it was not any thing accounted of in the days of Solomon.227 - 2 Chronicles 9:22     And king Solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.228 - 2 Chronicles 9:23     And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, that God had put in his heart.229 - 2 Chronicles 9:25     And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen; whom he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.230 - 2 Chronicles 9:28     And they brought unto Solomon horses out of Egypt, and out of all lands.231 - 2 Chronicles 9:29     Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not written in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer against Jeroboam the son of Nebat?232 - 2 Chronicles 9:30     And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.233 - 2 Chronicles 9:31     And Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.234 - 2 Chronicles 10:2     And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was in Egypt, whither he had fled from the presence of Solomon the king, heard it, that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt.235 - 2 Chronicles 10:6     And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye me to return answer to this people?236 - 2 Chronicles 11:3     Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,237 - 2 Chronicles 11:17     So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, three years: for three years they walked in the way of David and Solomon.238 - 2 Chronicles 12:9     So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king's house; he took all: he carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made.239 - 2 Chronicles 13:6     Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, is risen up, and hath rebelled against his lord.240 - 2 Chronicles 13:7     And there are gathered unto him vain men, the children of Belial, and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted, and could not withstand them.241 - 2 Chronicles 30:26     So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem.242 - 2 Chronicles 33:7     And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen before all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:243 - 2 Chronicles 35:3     And said unto the Levites that taught all Israel, which were holy unto the Lord, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build; it shall not be a burden upon your shoulders: serve now the Lord your God, and his people Israel,244 - 2 Chronicles 35:4     And prepare yourselves by the houses of your fathers, after your courses, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son.245 - Ezra 2:55     The children of Solomon's servants: the children of Sotai, the children of Sophereth, the children of Peruda,246 - Ezra 2:58     All the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon's servants, were three hundred ninety and two.247 - Nehemiah 7:57     The children of Solomon's servants: the children of Sotai, the children of Sophereth, the children of Perida,248 - Nehemiah 7:60     All the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon's servants, were three hundred ninety and two.249 - Nehemiah 11:3     Now these are the chief of the province that dwelt in Jerusalem: but in the cities of Judah dwelt every one in his possession in their cities, to wit, Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon's servants.250 - Nehemiah 12:45     And both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their God, and the ward of the purification, according to the commandment of David, and of Solomon his son.251 - Nehemiah 13:26     Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did outlandish women cause to sin.252 - Proverbs 1:1     The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;253 - Proverbs 10:1     The proverbs of Solomon.
