and she is the whore of all the earth.123 - 1 Nephi 14:12     And it came to pass that I beheld the church of the Lamb of God, and its numbers were few, because of the wickedness and abominations of the whore who sat upon many waters; nevertheless, I beheld that the church of the Lamb, who were the saints of God, were also upon all the face of the earth; and their dominions upon the face of the earth were small, because of the wickedness of the great whore whom I saw.124 - 1 Nephi 14:14     And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld the power of the Lamb of God, that it descended upon the saints of the church of the Lamb, and upon the covenant people of the Lord, who were scattered upon all the face of the earth; and they were armed with righteousness and with the power of God in great glory.125 - 1 Nephi 14:15     And it came to pass that I beheld that the wrath of God was poured out upon that great and abominable church, insomuch that there were wars and rumors of wars among all the nations and kindreds of the earth.126 - 1 Nephi 14:17     And when the day cometh that the wrath of God is poured out upon the mother of harlots, which is the great and abominable church of all the earth, whose founder is the devil, then, at that day, the work of the Father shall commence, in preparing the way for the fulfilling of his covenants, which he hath made to his people who are of the house of Israel.127 - 1 Nephi 22:13     And the blood of that great and abominable church, which is the whore of all the earth, shall turn upon their own heads; for they shall war among themselves, and the sword of their own hands shall fall upon their own heads, and they shall be drunken with their own blood.128 - 1 Nephi 22:14     And every nation which shall war against thee, O house of Israel, shall be turned one against another, and they shall fall into the pit which they digged to ensnare the people of the Lord. And all that fight against Zion shall be destroyed, and that great whore, who hath perverted the right ways of the Lord, yea, that great and abominable church, shall tumble to the dust and great shall be the fall of it.129 - 1 Nephi 22:23     For the time speedily shall come that all churches which are built up to get gain, and all those who are built up to get power over the flesh, and those who are built up to become popular in the eyes of the world, and those who seek the lusts of the flesh and the things of the world, and to do all manner of iniquity; yea, in fine, all those who belong to the kingdom of the devil are they who need fear, and tremble, and quake; they are those who must be brought low in the dust; they are those who must be consumed as stubble; and this is according to the words of the prophet.130 - 2 Nephi 6:12     And blessed are the Gentiles, they of whom the prophet has written; for behold, if it so be that they shall repent and fight not against Zion, and do not unite themselves to that great and abominable church, they shall be saved; for the Lord God will fulfil his covenants which he has made unto his children; and for this cause the prophet has written these things.131 - 2 Nephi 9:2     That he has spoken unto the Jews, by the mouth of his holy prophets, even from the beginning down, from generation to generation, until the time comes that they shall be restored to the true church and fold of God; when they shall be gathered home to the lands of their inheritance, and shall be established in all their lands of promise.132 - 2 Nephi 25:14     And behold it shall come to pass that after the Messiah hath risen from the dead, and hath manifested himself unto his people, unto as many as will believe on his name, behold, Jerusalem shall be destroyed again; for wo unto them that fight against God and the people of his church.133 - 2 Nephi 26:20     And the Gentiles are lifted up in the pride of their eyes, and have stumbled, because of the greatness of their stumbling block, that they have built up many churches; nevertheless, they put down the power and miracles of God, and preach up unto themselves their own wisdom and their own learning, that they may get gain and grind upon the face of the poor.134 - 2 Nephi 26:21     And there are many churches built up which cause envyings, and strifes, and malice.135 - 2 Nephi 28:3     For it shall come to pass in that day that the churches which are built up, and not unto the Lord, when the one shall say unto the other: Behold, I, I am the Lord's; and the others shall say: I, I am the Lord's; and thus shall every one say that hath built up churches, and not unto the Lord--136 - 2 Nephi 28:12     Because of pride, and because of false teachers, and false doctrine, their churches have become corrupted, and their churches are lifted up; because of pride they are puffed up.137 - 2 Nephi 28:18     But behold, that great and abominable church, the whore of all the earth, must tumble to the earth, and great must be the fall thereof.138 - Mosiah 18:17     And they were called the church of God, or the church of Christ, from that time forward. And it came to pass that whosoever was baptized by the power and authority of God was added to his church.139 - Mosiah 18:27     And again Alma commanded that the people of the church should impart of their substance, every one according to that which he had; if he have more abundantly he should impart more abundantly; and of him that had but little, but little should be required; and to him that had not should be given.140 - Mosiah 21:30     And also that king Noah and his priests had caused the people to commit so many sins and iniquities against God; and they also did mourn for the death of Abinadi; and also for the departure of Alma and the people that went with him, who had formed a church of God through the strength and power of God, and faith on the words which had been spoken by Abinadi.141 - Mosiah 21:34     Therefore they did not at that time form themselves into a church, waiting upon the Spirit of the Lord. Now they were desirous to become even as Alma and his brethren, who had fled into the wilderness.142 - Mosiah 23:16     And now, Alma was their high priest, he being the founder of their church.143 - Mosiah 25:18     Therefore, Alma did go forth into the water and did baptize them; yea, he did baptize them after the manner he did his brethren in the waters of Mormon; yea, and as many as he did baptize did belong to the church of God; and this because of their belief on the words of Alma.144 - Mosiah 25:19     And it came to pass that king Mosiah granted unto Alma that he might establish churches throughout all the land of Zarahemla; and gave him power to ordain priests and teachers over every church.145 - Mosiah 25:21     Therefore they did assemble themselves together in different bodies, being called churches; every church having their priests and their teachers, and every priest preaching the word according as it was delivered to him by the mouth of Alma.146 - Mosiah 25:22     And thus, notwithstanding there being many churches they were all one church, yea, even the church of God; for there was nothing preached in all the churches except it were repentance and faith in God.147 - Mosiah 25:23     And now there were seven churches in the land of Zarahemla. And it came to pass that whosoever were desirous to take upon them the name of Christ, or of God, they did join the churches of God;148 - Mosiah 26:4     And they would not be baptized; neither would they join the church. And they were a separate people as to their faith, and remained so ever after, even in their carnal and sinful state; for they would not call upon the Lord their God.149 - Mosiah 26:6     For it came to pass that they did deceive many with their flattering words, who were in the church, and did cause them to commit many sins; therefore it became expedient that those who committed sin, that were in the church, should be admonished by the church.150 - Mosiah 26:8     Now king Mosiah had given Alma the authority over the church.151 - Mosiah 26:10     Now there had not any such thing happened before in the church; therefore Alma was troubled in his spirit, and he caused that they should be brought before the king.152 - Mosiah 26:17     And blessed art thou because thou hast established a church among this people; and they shall be established, and they shall be my people.153 - Mosiah 26:21     And he that will hear my voice shall be my sheep; and him shall ye receive into the church, and him will I also receive.154 - Mosiah 26:22     For behold, this is my church; whosoever is baptized shall be baptized unto repentance. And whomsoever ye receive shall believe in my name; and him will I freely forgive.155 - Mosiah 26:28     Therefore I say unto you, that he that will not hear my voice, the same shall ye not receive into my church, for him I will not receive at the last day.156 - Mosiah 26:33     And it came to pass when Alma had heard these words he wrote them down that he might have them, and that he might judge the people of that church according to the commandments of God.157 - Mosiah 26:35     And whosoever repented of their sins and did confess them, them he did number among the people of the church;158 - Mosiah 26:36     And those that would not confess their sins and repent of their iniquity, the same were not numbered among the people of the church, and their names were blotted out.159 - Mosiah 26:37     And it came to pass that Alma did regulate all the affairs of the church; and they began again to have peace and to prosper exceedingly in the affairs of the church, walking circumspectly before God, receiving many, and baptizing many.160 - Mosiah 26:38     And now all these things did Alma and his fellow laborers do who were over the church, walking in all diligence, teaching the word of God in all things, suffering all manner of afflictions, being persecuted by all those who did not belong to the church of God.161 - Mosiah 27:1     And now it came to pass that the persecutions which were inflicted on the church by the unbelievers became so great that the church began to murmur, and complain to their leaders concerning the matter; and they did complain to Alma. And Alma laid the case before their king, Mosiah. And Mosiah consulted with his priests.162 - Mosiah 27:2     And it came to pass that king Mosiah sent a proclamation throughout the land round about that there should not any unbeliever persecute any of those who belonged to the church of God.163 - Mosiah 27:3     And there was a strict command throughout all the churches that there should be no persecutions among them, that there should be an equality among all men;164 - Mosiah 27:9     And he became a great hinderment to the prosperity of the church of God; stealing away the hearts of the people; causing much dissension among the people; giving a chance for the enemy of God to exercise his power over them.165 - Mosiah 27:10     And now it came to pass that while he was going about to destroy the church of God, for he did go about secretly with the sons of Mosiah seeking to destroy the church, and to lead astray the people of the Lord, contrary to the commandments of God, or even the king--166 - Mosiah 27:13     Nevertheless he cried again, saying: Alma, arise and stand forth, for why persecutest thou the church of God? For the Lord hath said: This is my church, and I will establish it; and nothing shall overthrow it, save it is the transgression of my people.167 - Mosiah 27:16     Now I say unto thee: Go, and remember the captivity of thy fathers in the land of Helam, and in the land of Nephi; and remember how great things he has done for them; for they were in bondage, and he has delivered them. And now I say unto thee, Alma, go thy way, and seek to destroy the church no more, that their prayers may be answered, and this even if thou wilt of thyself be cast off.168 - Mosiah 27:33     But notwithstanding all this, they did impart much consolation to the church, confirming their faith, and exhorting them with long-suffering and much travail to keep the commandments of God.169 - Mosiah 27:35     And they traveled throughout all the land of Zarahemla, and among all the people who were under the reign of king Mosiah, zealously striving to repair all the injuries which they had done to the church, confessing all their sins, and publishing all the things which they had seen, and explaining the prophecies and the scriptures to all who desired to hear them.170 - Mosiah 29:42     And it came to pass that Alma was appointed to be the first chief judge, he being also the high priest, his father having conferred the office upon him, and having given him the charge concerning all the affairs of the church.171 - Mosiah 29:47     And thus ended the reign of the kings over the people of Nephi; and thus ended the days of Alma, who was the founder of their church.172 - Alma 1:3     And he had gone about among the people, preaching to them that which he termed to be the word of God, bearing down against the church; declaring unto the people that every priest and teacher ought to become popular; and they ought not to labor with their hands, but that they ought to be supported by the people.173 - Alma 1:6     And he began to be lifted up in the pride of his heart, and to wear very costly apparel, yea, and even began to establish a church after the manner of his preaching.174 - Alma 1:7     And it came to pass as he was going, to preach to those who believed on his word, he met a man who belonged to the church of God, yea, even one of their teachers; and he began to contend with him sharply, that he might lead away the people of the church; but the man withstood him, admonishing him with the words of God.175 - Alma 1:10     And the man who slew him was taken by the people of the church, and was brought before Alma, to be judged according to the crimes which he had committed.176 - Alma 1:19     But it came to pass that whosoever did not belong to the church of God began to persecute those that did belong to the church of God, and had taken upon them the name of Christ.177 - Alma 1:21     Now there was a strict law among the people of the church, that there should not any man, belonging to the church, arise and persecute those that did not belong to the church, and that there should be no persecution among themselves.178 - Alma 1:23     Now this was in the second year of the reign of Alma, and it was a cause of much affliction to the church; yea, it was the cause of much trial with the church.179 - Alma 1:28     And thus they did establish the affairs of the church; and thus they began to have continual peace again, notwithstanding all their persecutions.180 - Alma 1:29     And now, because of the steadiness of the church they began to be exceedingly rich, having abundance of all things whatsoever they stood in need--an abundance of flocks and herds, and fatlings of every kind, and also abundance of grain, and of gold, and of silver, and of precious things, and abundance of silk and fine-twined linen, and all manner of good homely cloth.181 - Alma 1:30     And thus, in their prosperous circumstances, they did not send away any who were naked, or that were hungry, or that were athirst, or that were sick, or that had not been nourished; and they did not set their hearts upon riches; therefore they were liberal to all, both old and young, both bond and free, both male and female, whether out of the church or in the church, having no respect to persons as to those who stood in need.182 - Alma 1:31     And thus they did prosper and become far more wealthy than those who did not belong to their church.183 - Alma 1:32     For those who did not belong to their church did indulge themselves in sorceries, and in idolatry or idleness, and in babblings, and in envyings and strife; wearing costly apparel; being lifted up in the pride of their own eyes; persecuting, lying, thieving, robbing, committing whoredoms, and murdering, and all manner of wickedness; nevertheless, the law was put in force upon all those who did transgress it, inasmuch as it was possible.184 - Alma 2:3     Now this was alarming to the people of the church, and also to all those who had not been drawn away after the persuasions of Amlici; for they knew that according to their law that such things must be established by the voice of the people.185 - Alma 2:4     Therefore, if it were possible that Amlici should gain the voice of the people, he, being a wicked man, would deprive them of their rights and privileges of the church; for it was his intent to destroy the church of God.186 - Alma 4:4     And they began to establish the church more fully; yea, and many were baptized in the waters of Sidon and were joined to the church of God; yea, they were baptized by the hand of Alma, who had been consecrated the high priest over the people of the church, by the hand of his father Alma.187 - Alma 4:5     And it came to pass in the seventh year of the reign of the judges there were about three thousand five hundred souls that united themselves to the church of God and were baptized. And thus ended the seventh year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi; and there was continual peace in all that time.188 - Alma 4:6     And it came to pass in the eighth year of the reign of the judges, that the people of the church began to wax proud, because of their exceeding riches, and their fine silks, and their fine-twined linen, and because of their many flocks and herds, and their gold and their silver, and all manner of precious things, which they had obtained by their industry; and in all these things were they lifted up in the pride of their eyes, for they began to wear very costly apparel.189 - Alma 4:7     Now this was the cause of much affliction to Alma, yea, and to many of the people whom Alma had consecrated to be teachers, and priests, and elders over the church; yea, many of them were sorely grieved for the wickedness which they saw had begun to be among their people.190 - Alma 4:8     For they saw and beheld with great sorrow that the people of the church began to be lifted up in the pride of their eyes, and to set their hearts upon riches and upon the vain things of the world, that they began to be scornful, one towards another, and they began to persecute those that did not believe according to their own will and pleasure.191 - Alma 4:9     And thus, in this eighth year of the reign of the judges, there began to be great contentions among the people of the church; yea, there were envyings, and strife, and malice, and persecutions, and pride, even to exceed the pride of those who did not belong to the church of God.192 - Alma 4:10     And thus ended the eighth year of the reign of the judges; and the wickedness of the church was a great stumbling-block to those who did not belong to the church; and thus the church began to fail in its progress.193 - Alma 4:11     And it came to pass in the commencement of the ninth year, Alma saw the wickedness of the church, and he saw also that the example of the church began to lead those who were unbelievers on from one piece of iniquity to another, thus bringing on the destruction of the people.194 - Alma 4:16     And he selected a wise man who was among the elders of the church, and gave him power according to the voice of the people, that he might have power to enact laws according to the laws which had been given, and to put them in force according to the wickedness and the crimes of the people.195 - Alma 4:18     Now Alma did not grant unto him the office of being high priest over the church, but he retained the office of high priest unto himself; but he delivered the judgment-seat unto Nephihah.196 - Alma 5:2     And these are the words which he spake to the people in the church which was established in the city of Zarahemla, according to his own record, saying:197 - Alma 5:3     I, Alma, having been consecrated by my father, Alma, to be a high priest over the church of God, he having power and authority from God to do these things, behold, I say unto you that he began to establish a church in the land which was in the borders of Nephi; yea, the land which was called the land of Mormon; yea, and he did baptize his brethren in the waters of Mormon.198 - Alma 5:5     And behold, after that, they were brought into bondage by the hands of the Lamanites in the wilderness; yea, I say unto you, they were in captivity, and again the Lord did deliver them out of bondage by the power of his word; and we were brought into this land, and here we began to establish the church of God throughout this land also.199 - Alma 5:6     And now behold, I say unto you, my brethren, you that belong to this church, have you sufficiently retained in remembrance the captivity of your fathers? Yea, and have you sufficiently retained in remembrance his mercy and long-suffering towards them? And moreover, have ye sufficiently retained in remembrance that he has delivered their souls from hell?200 - Alma 5:14     And now behold, I ask of you, my brethren of the church, have ye spiritually been born of God? Have ye received his image in your countenances? Have ye experienced this mighty change in your hearts?201 - Alma 5:54     Yea, will ye persist in supposing that ye are better one than another; yea, will ye persist in the persecution of your brethren, who humble themselves and do walk after the holy order of God, wherewith they have been brought into this church, having been sanctified by the Holy Spirit, and they do bring forth works which are meet for repentance--202 - Alma 5:62     I speak by way of command unto you that belong to the church; and unto those who do not belong to the church I speak by way of invitation, saying: Come and be baptized unto repentance, that ye also may be partakers of the fruit of the tree of life.203 - Alma 6:1     And now it came to pass that after Alma had made an end of speaking unto the people of the church, which was established in the city of Zarahemla, he ordained priests and elders, by laying on his hands according to the order of God, to preside and watch over the church.204 - Alma 6:2     And it came to pass that whosoever did not belong to the church who repented of their sins were baptized unto repentance, and were received into the church.205 - Alma 6:3     And it also came to pass that whosoever did belong to the church that did not repent of their wickedness and humble themselves before God--I mean those who were lifted up in the pride of their hearts--the same were rejected, and their names were blotted out, that their names were not numbered among those of the righteous.206 - Alma 6:4     And thus they began to establish the order of the church in the city of Zarahemla.207 - Alma 6:7     And now it came to pass that when Alma had made these regulations he departed from them, yea, from the church which was in the city of Zarahemla, and went over upon the east of the river Sidon, into the valley of Gideon, there having been a city built, which was called the city of Gideon, which was in the valley that was called Gideon, being called after the man who was slain by the hand of Nehor with the sword.208 - Alma 6:8     And Alma went and began to declare the word of God unto the church which was established in the valley of Gideon, according to the revelation of the truth of the word which had been spoken by his fathers, and according to the spirit of prophecy which was in him, according to the testimony of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who should come to redeem his people from their sins, and the holy order by which he was called. And thus it is written. Amen.209 - Alma 8:1     And now it came to pass that Alma returned from the land of Gideon, after having taught the people of Gideon many things which cannot be written, having established the order of the church, according as he had before done in the land of Zarahemla, yea, he returned to his own house at Zarahemla to rest himself from the labors which he had performed.210 - Alma 8:11     Nevertheless, they hardened their hearts, saying unto him: Behold, we know that thou art Alma; and we know that thou art high priest over the church which thou hast established in many parts of the land, according to your tradition; and we are not of thy church, and we do not believe in such foolish traditions.211 - Alma 8:12     And now we know that because we are not of thy church we know that thou hast no power over us; and thou hast delivered up the judgment-seat unto Nephihah; therefore thou art not the chief judge over us.212 - Alma 8:23     And after he had eaten and was filled he said unto Amulek: I am Alma, and am the high priest over the church of God throughout the land.213 - Alma 15:13     And Alma established a church in the land of Sidom, and consecrated priests and teachers in the land, to baptize unto the Lord whosoever were desirous to be baptized.214 - Alma 15:17     Therefore, after Alma having established the church at Sidom, seeing a great check, yea, seeing that the people were checked as to the pride of their hearts, and began to humble themselves before God, and began to assemble themselves together at their sanctuaries to worship God before the altar, watching and praying continually, that they might be delivered from Satan, and from death, and from destruction--215 - Alma 16:5     Therefore, he that had been appointed chief captain over the armies of the Nephites, (and his name was Zoram, and he had two sons, Lehi and Aha)--now Zoram and his two sons, knowing that Alma was high priest over the church, and having heard that he had the spirit of prophecy, therefore they went unto him and desired of him to know whither the Lord would that they should go into the wilderness in search of their brethren, who had been taken captive by the Lamanites.216 - Alma 16:15     And thus did Alma and Amulek go forth, and also many more who had been chosen for the work, to preach the word throughout all the land. And the establishment of the church became general throughout the land, in all the region round about, among all the people of the Nephites.217 - Alma 16:21     And now after the church had been established throughout all the land--having got the victory over the devil, and the word of God being preached in its purity in all the land, and the Lord pouring out his blessings upon the people--thus ended the fourteenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.218 - Alma 19:35     And it came to pass that there were many that did believe in their words; and as many as did believe were baptized; and they became a righteous people, and they did establish a church among them.219 - Alma 20:1     And it came to pass that when they had established a church in that land, that king Lamoni desired that Ammon should go with him to the land of Nephi, that he might show him unto his father.220 - Alma 23:4     And now it came to pass that when the king had sent forth this proclamation, that Aaron and his brethren went forth from city to city, and from one house of worship to another, establishing churches, and consecrating priests and teachers throughout the land among the Lamanites, to preach and to teach the word of God among them; and thus they began to have great success.221 - Alma 26:18     Behold, we went forth even in wrath, with mighty threatenings to destroy his church.222 - Alma 27:27     And they were among the people of Nephi, and also numbered among the people who were of the church of God. And they were also distinguished for their zeal towards God, and also towards men; for they were perfectly honest and upright in all things; and they were firm in the faith of Christ, even unto the end.223 - Alma 28:1     And now it came to pass that after the people of Ammon were established in the land of Jershon, and a church also established in the land of Jershon, and the armies of the Nephites were set round about the land of Jershon, yea, in all the borders round about the land of Zarahemla; behold the armies of the Lamanites had followed their brethren into the wilderness.224 - Alma 29:11     Yea, and I also remember the captivity of my fathers; for I surely do know that the Lord did deliver them out of bondage, and by this did establish his church; yea, the Lord God, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, did deliver them out of bondage.225 - Alma 29:13     Yea, and that same God did establish his church among them; yea, and that same God hath called me by a holy calling, to preach the word unto this people, and hath given me much success, in the which my joy is full.226 - Alma 30:33     And notwithstanding the many labors which I have performed in the church, I have never received so much as even one senine for my labor; neither has any of my brethren, save it were in the judgment-seat; and then we have received only according to law for our time.227 - Alma 30:34     And now, if we do not receive anything for our labors in the church, what doth it profit us to labor in the church save it were to declare the truth, that we may have rejoicings in the joy of our brethren?228 - Alma 31:6     Therefore he took Ammon, and Aaron, and Omner; and Himni he did leave in the church in Zarahemla; but the former three he took with him, and also Amulek and Zeezrom, who were at Melek; and he also took two of his sons.229 - Alma 31:10     Neither would they observe the performances of the church, to continue in prayer and supplication to God daily, that they might not enter into temptation.230 - Alma 36:6     For I went about with the sons of Mosiah, seeking to destroy the church of God; but behold, God sent his holy angel to stop us by the way.231 - Alma 36:9     And he said unto me: If thou wilt of thyself be destroyed, seek no more to destroy the church of God.232 - Alma 36:11     And the angel spake more things unto me, which were heard by my brethren, but I did not hear them; for when I heard the words--If thou wilt be destroyed of thyself, seek no more to destroy the church of God--I was struck with such great fear and amazement lest perhaps I should be destroyed, that I fell to the earth and I did hear no more.233 - Alma 43:30     And he also knowing that it was the only desire of the Nephites to preserve their lands, and their liberty, and their church, therefore he thought it no sin that he should defend them by stratagem; therefore, he found by his spies which course the Lamanites were to take.234 - Alma 43:45     Nevertheless, the Nephites were inspired by a better cause, for they were not fighting for monarchy nor power but they were fighting for their homes and their liberties, their wives and their children, and their all, yea, for their rites of worship and their church.235 - Alma 44:5     And now, Zerahemnah, I command you, in the name of that all-powerful God, who has strengthened our arms that we have gained power over you, by our faith, by our religion, and by our rites of worship, and by our church, and by the sacred support which we owe to our wives and our children, by that liberty which binds us to our lands and our country; yea, and also by the maintenance of the sacred word of God, to which we owe all our happiness; and by all that is most dear unto us--236 - Alma 45:17     And now, when Alma had said these words he blessed the church, yea, all those who should stand fast in the faith from that time henceforth.237 - Alma 45:19     Behold, this we know, that he was a righteous man; and the saying went abroad in the church that he was taken up by the Spirit, or buried by the hand of the Lord, even as Moses. But behold, the scriptures saith the Lord took Moses unto himself; and we suppose that he has also received Alma in the spirit, unto himself; therefore, for this cause we know nothing concerning his death and burial.238 - Alma 45:21     For behold, because of their wars with the Lamanites and the many little dissensions and disturbances which had been among the people, it became expedient that the word of God should be declared among them, yea, and that a regulation should be made throughout the church.239 - Alma 45:22     Therefore, Helaman and his brethren went forth to establish the church again in all the land, yea, in every city throughout all the land which was possessed by the people of Nephi. And it came to pass that they did appoint priests and teachers throughout all the land, over all the churches.240 - Alma 45:23     And now it came to pass that after Helaman and his brethren had appointed priests and teachers over the churches that there arose a dissension among them, and they would not give heed to the words of Helaman and his brethren;241 - Alma 46:6     Thus they were led away by Amalickiah to dissensions, notwithstanding the preaching of Helaman and his brethren, yea, notwithstanding their exceedingly great care over the church, for they were high priests over the church.242 - Alma 46:7     And there were many in the church who believed in the flattering words of Amalickiah, therefore they dissented even from the church; and thus were the affairs of the people of Nephi exceedingly precarious and dangerous, notwithstanding their great victory which they had had over the Lamanites, and their great rejoicings which they had had because of their deliverance by the hand of the Lord.243 - Alma 46:10     Yea, we see that Amalickiah, because he was a man of cunning device and a man of many flattering words, that he led away the hearts of many people to do wickedly; yea, and to seek to destroy the church of God, and to destroy the foundation of liberty which God had granted unto them, or which blessing God had sent upon the face of the land for the righteous' sake.244 - Alma 46:14     For thus were all the true believers of Christ, who belonged to the church of God, called by those who did not belong to the church.245 - Alma 46:15     And those who did belong to the church were faithful; yea, all those who were true believers in Christ took upon them, gladly, the name of Christ, or Christians as they were called, because of their belief in Christ who should come.246 - Alma 46:38     And Helaman and the high priests did also maintain order in the church; yea, even for the space of four years did they have much peace and rejoicing in the church.247 - Alma 48:24     Nevertheless, they could not suffer to lay down their lives, that their wives and their children should be massacred by the barbarous cruelty of those who were once their brethren, yea, and had dissented from their church, and had left them and had gone to destroy them by joining the Lamanites.248 - Alma 49:30     Yea, and there was continual peace among them, and exceedingly great prosperity in the church because of their heed and diligence which they gave unto the word of God, which was declared unto them by Helaman, and Shiblon, and Corianton, and Ammon and his brethren, yea, and by all those who had been ordained by the holy order of God, being baptized unto repentance, and sent forth to preach among the people.249 - Alma 61:14     Therefore, my beloved brother, Moroni, let us resist evil, and whatsoever evil we cannot resist with our words, yea, such as rebellions and dissensions, let us resist them with our swords, that we may retain our freedom, that we may rejoice in the great privilege of our church, and in the cause of our Redeemer and our God.250 - Alma 62:44     And Pahoran did return to his judgment-seat; and Helaman did take upon him again to preach unto the people the word of God; for because of so many wars and contentions it had become expedient that a regulation should be made again in the church.251 - Alma 62:46     And it came to pass that they did establish again the church of God, throughout all the land.252 - Helaman 3:1     And now it came to pass in the forty and third year of the reign of the judges, there was no contention among the people of Nephi save it were a little pride which was in the church, which did cause some little dissensions among the people, which affairs were settled in the ending of the forty and third year.253 - Helaman 3:24     And it came to pass that in this same year there was exceedingly great prosperity in the church, insomuch that there were thousands who did join themselves unto the church and were baptized unto repentance.254 - Helaman 3:25     And so great was the prosperity of the church, and so many the blessings which were poured out upon the people, that even the high priests and the teachers were themselves astonished beyond measure.255 - Helaman 3:26     And it came to pass that the work of the Lord did prosper unto the baptizing and uniting to the church of God, many souls, yea, even tens of thousands.256 - Helaman 3:33     And in the fifty and first year of the reign of the judges there was peace also, save it were the pride which began to enter into the church--not into the church of God, but into the hearts of the people who professed to belong to the church of God--257 - Helaman 4:1     And it came to pass in the fifty and fourth year there were many dissensions in the church, and there was also a contention among the people, insomuch that there was much bloodshed.258 - Helaman 4:11     Now this great loss of the Nephites, and the great slaughter which was among them, would not have happened had it not been for their wickedness and their abomination which was among them; yea, and it was among those also who professed to belong to the church of God.259 - Helaman 4:23     And because of their iniquity the church had begun to dwindle; and they began to disbelieve in the spirit of prophecy and in the spirit of revelation; and the judgments of God did stare them in the face.260 - Helaman 5:35     Now there was one among them who was a Nephite by birth, who had once belonged to the church of God but had dissented from them.261 - Helaman 6:3     Nevertheless, the people of the church did have great joy because of the conversion of the Lamanites, yea, because of the church of God, which had been established among them. And they did fellowship one with another, and did rejoice one with another, and did have great joy.262 - Helaman 11:21     And it came to pass that the seventy and sixth year did end in peace. And the seventy and seventh year began in peace; and the church did spread throughout the face of all the land; and the more part of the people, both the Nephites and the Lamanites, did belong to the church; and they did have exceedingly great peace in the land; and thus ended the seventy and seventh year.263 - 3 Nephi 2:12     Therefore, all the Lamanites who had become converted unto the Lord did unite with their brethren, the Nephites, and were compelled, for the safety of their lives and their women and their children, to take up arms against those Gadianton robbers, yea, and also to maintain their rights, and the privileges of their church and of their worship, and their freedom and their liberty.264 - 3 Nephi 5:12     And behold, I am called Mormon, being called after the land of Mormon, the land in which Alma did establish the church among the people, yea, the first church which was established among them after their transgression.265 - 3 Nephi 6:14     And thus there became a great inequality in all the land, insomuch that the church began to be broken up; yea, insomuch that in the thirtieth year the church was broken up in all the land save it were among a few of the Lamanites who were converted unto the true faith; and they would not depart from it, for they were firm, and steadfast, and immovable, willing with all diligence to keep the commandments of the Lord.266 - 3 Nephi 18:5     And when the multitude had eaten and were filled, he said unto the disciples: Behold there shall one be ordained among you, and to him will I give power that he shall break bread and bless it and give it unto the people of my church, unto all those who shall believe and be baptized in my name.267 - 3 Nephi 18:16     And as I have prayed among you even so shall ye pray in my church, among my people who do repent and are baptized in my name. Behold I am the light; I have set an example for you.268 - 3 Nephi 21:22     But if they will repent and hearken unto my words, and harden not their hearts, I will establish my church among them, and they shall come in unto the covenant and be numbered among this the remnant of Jacob, unto whom I have given this land for their inheritance;269 - 3 Nephi 26:21     And they who were baptized in the name of Jesus were called the church of Christ.270 - 3 Nephi 27:3     And they said unto him: Lord, we will that thou wouldst tell us the name whereby we shall call this church; for there are disputations among the people concerning this matter.271 - 3 Nephi 27:7     Therefore, whatsoever ye shall do, ye shall do it in my name; therefore ye shall call the church in my name; and ye shall call upon the Father in my name that he will bless the church for my sake.272 - 3 Nephi 27:8     And how be it my church save it be called in my name? For if a church be called in Moses' name then it be Moses' church; or if it be called in the name of a man then it be the church of a man; but if it be called in my name then it is my church, if it so be that they are built upon my gospel.273 - 3 Nephi 27:9     Verily I say unto you, that ye are built upon my gospel; therefore ye shall call whatsoever things ye do call, in my name; therefore if ye call upon the Father, for the church, if it be in my name the Father will hear you;274 - 3 Nephi 27:10     And if it so be that the church is built upon my gospel then will the Father show forth his own works in it.275 - 3 Nephi 27:21     Verily, verily, I say unto you, this is my gospel; and ye know the things that ye must do in my church; for the works which ye have seen me do that shall ye also do; for that which ye have seen me do even that shall ye do;276 - 3 Nephi 28:18     But this much I know, according to the record which hath been given--they did go forth upon the face of the land, and did minister unto all the people, uniting as many to the church as would believe in their preaching; baptizing them, and as many as were baptized did receive the Holy Ghost.277 - 3 Nephi 28:19     And they were cast into prison by them who did not belong to the church. And the prisons could not hold them, for they were rent in twain.278 - 3 Nephi 28:23     And it came to pass that thus they did go forth among all the people of Nephi, and did preach the gospel of Christ unto all people upon the face of the land; and they were converted unto the Lord, and were united unto the church of Christ, and thus the people of that generation were blessed, according to the word of Jesus.279 - 4 Nephi 1:1     And it came to pass that the thirty and fourth year passed away, and also the thirty and fifth, and behold the disciples of Jesus had formed a church of Christ in all the lands round about. And as many as did come unto them, and did truly repent of their sins, were baptized in the name of Jesus; and they did also receive the Holy Ghost.280 - 4 Nephi 1:20     And he kept it eighty and four years, and there was still peace in the land, save it were a small part of the people who had revolted from the church and taken upon them the name of Lamanites; therefore there began to be Lamanites again in the land.281 - 4 Nephi 1:26     And they began to be divided into classes; and they began to build up churches unto themselves to get gain, and began to deny the true church of Christ.282 - 4 Nephi 1:27     And it came to pass that when two hundred and ten years had passed away there were many churches in the land; yea, there were many churches which professed to know the Christ, and yet they did deny the more parts of his gospel, insomuch that they did receive all manner of wickedness, and did administer that which was sacred unto him to whom it had been forbidden because of unworthiness.283 - 4 Nephi 1:28     And this church did multiply exceedingly because of iniquity, and because of the power of Satan who did get hold upon their hearts.284 - 4 Nephi 1:29     And again, there was another church which denied the Christ; and they did persecute the true church of Christ, because of their humility and their belief in Christ; and they did despise them because of the many miracles which were wrought among them.285 - 4 Nephi 1:34     Nevertheless, the people did harden their hearts, for they were led by many priests and false prophets to build up many churches, and to do all manner of iniquity. And they did smite upon the people of Jesus; but the people of Jesus did not smite again. And thus they did dwindle in unbelief and wickedness, from year to year, even until two hundred and thirty years had passed away.286 - 4 Nephi 1:41     And they did still continue to build up churches unto themselves, and adorn them with all manner of precious things. And thus did two hundred and fifty years pass away, and also two hundred and sixty years.287 - Mormon 3:2     And it came to pass that the Lord did say unto me: Cry unto this people--Repent ye, and come unto me, and be ye baptized, and build up again my church, and ye shall be spared.288 - Mormon 8:28     Yea, it shall come in a day when the power of God shall be denied, and churches become defiled and be lifted up in the pride of their hearts; yea, even in a day when leaders of churches and teachers shall rise in the pride of their hearts, even to the envying of them who belong to their churches.289 - Mormon 8:32     Yea, it shall come in a day when there shall be churches built up that shall say: Come unto me, and for your money you shall be forgiven of your sins.290 - Mormon 8:33     O ye wicked and perverse and stiffnecked people, why have ye built up churches unto yourselves to get gain? Why have ye transfigured the holy word of God, that ye might bring damnation upon your souls? Behold, look ye unto the revelations of God; for behold, the time cometh at that day when all these things must be fulfilled.291 - Mormon 8:36     And I know that ye do walk in the pride of your hearts; and there are none save a few only who do not lift themselves up in the pride of their hearts, unto the wearing of very fine apparel, unto envying, and strifes, and malice, and persecutions, and all manner of iniquities; and your churches, yea, even every one, have become polluted because of the pride of your hearts.292 - Mormon 8:37     For behold, ye do love money, and your substance, and your fine apparel, and the adorning of your churches, more than ye love the poor and the needy, the sick and the afflicted.293 - Mormon 8:38     O ye pollutions, ye hypocrites, ye teachers, who sell yourselves for that which will canker, why have ye polluted the holy church of God? Why are ye ashamed to take upon you the name of Christ? Why do ye not think that greater is the value of an endless happiness than that misery which never dies--because of the praise of the world?294 - Moroni 3:1     The manner which the disciples, who were called the elders of the church, ordained priests and teachers--295 - Moroni 4:1     The manner of their elders and priests administering the flesh and blood of Christ unto the church; and they administered it according to the commandments of Christ; wherefore we know the manner to be true; and the elder or priest did minister it--296 - Moroni 4:2     And they did kneel down with the church, and pray to the Father in the name of Christ, saying:297 - Moroni 6:2     Neither did they receive any unto baptism save they came forth with a broken heart and a contrite spirit, and witnessed unto the church that they truly repented of all their sins.298 - Moroni 6:4     And after they had been received unto baptism, and were wrought upon and cleansed by the power of the Holy Ghost, they were numbered among the people of the church of Christ; and their names were taken, that they might be remembered and nourished by the good word of God, to keep them in the right way, to keep them continually watchful unto prayer, relying alone upon the merits of Christ, who was the author and the finisher of their faith.299 - Moroni 6:5     And the church did meet together oft, to fast and to pray, and to speak one with another concerning the welfare of their souls.300 - Moroni 6:7     And they were strict to observe that there should be no iniquity among them; and whoso was found to commit iniquity, and three witnesses of the church did condemn them before the elders, and if they repented not, and confessed not, their names were blotted out, and they were not numbered among the people of Christ.301 - Moroni 6:9     And their meetings were conducted by the church after the manner of the workings of the Spirit, and by the power of the Holy Ghost; for as the power of the Holy Ghost led them whether to preach, or to exhort, or to pray, or to supplicate, or to sing, even so it was done.302 - Moroni 7:3     Wherefore, I would speak unto you that are of the church, that are the peaceable followers of Christ, and that have obtained a sufficient hope by which ye can enter into the rest of the Lord, from this time henceforth until ye shall rest with him in heaven.303 - Moroni 7:39     But behold, my beloved brethren, I judge better things of you, for I judge that ye have faith in Christ because of your meekness; for if ye have not faith in him then ye are not fit to be numbered among the people of his church.304 - Doctrine and Covenants 1:1     Hearken, O ye people of my church, saith the voice of him who dwells on high, and whose eyes are upon all men; yea, verily I say: Hearken ye people from afar; and ye that are upon the islands of the sea, listen together.305 - Doctrine and Covenants 1:30     And also those to whom these commandments were given, might have power to lay the foundation of this church, and to bring it forth out of obscurity and out of darkness, the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth, with which I, the Lord, am well pleased, speaking unto the church collectively and not individually--306 - Doctrine and Covenants 5:14     And to none else will I grant this power, to receive this same testimony among this generation, in this the beginning of the rising up and the coming forth of my church out of the wilderness--clear as the moon, and fair as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners.307 - Doctrine and Covenants 10:53     And for this cause have I said: If this generation harden not their hearts, I will establish my church among them.308 - Doctrine and Covenants 10:54     Now I do not say this to destroy my church, but I say this to build up my church;309 - Doctrine and Covenants 10:55     Therefore, whosoever belongeth to my church need not fear, for such shall inherit the kingdom of heaven.310 - Doctrine and Covenants 10:56     But it is they who do not fear me, neither keep my commandments but build up churches unto themselves to get gain, yea, and all those that do wickedly and build up the kingdom of the devil--yea, verily, verily, I say unto you, that it is they that I will disturb, and cause to tremble and shake to the center.311 - Doctrine and Covenants 10:67     Behold, this is my doctrine--whosoever repenteth and cometh unto me, the same is my church.312 - Doctrine and Covenants 10:68     Whosoever declareth more or less than this, the same is not of me, but is against me; therefore he is not of my church.313 - Doctrine and Covenants 10:69     And now, behold, whosoever is of my church, and endureth of my church to the end, him will I establish upon my rock, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against them.314 - Doctrine and Covenants 11:16     Wait a little longer, until you shall have my word, my rock, my church, and my gospel, that you may know of a surety my doctrine.315 - Doctrine and Covenants 18:4     For in them are all things written concerning the foundation of my church, my gospel, and my rock.316 - Doctrine and Covenants 18:5     Wherefore, if you shall build up my church, upon the foundation of my gospel and my rock, the gates of hell shall not prevail against you.317 - Doctrine and Covenants 18:20     Contend against no church, save it be the church of the devil.318 - Doctrine and Covenants 20:1     The rise of the Church of Christ in these last days, being one thousand eight hundred and thirty years since the coming of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ in the flesh, it being regularly organized and established agreeable to the laws of our country, by the will and commandments of God, in the fourth month, and on the sixth day of the month which is called April--319 - Doctrine and Covenants 20:2     Which commandments were given to Joseph Smith, Jun., who was called of God, and ordained an apostle of Jesus Christ, to be the first elder of this church;320 - Doctrine and Covenants 20:3     And to Oliver Cowdery, who was also called of God, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to be the second elder of this church, and ordained under his hand;321 - Doctrine and Covenants 20:16     For the Lord God has spoken it; and we, the elders of the church, have heard and bear witness to the words of the glorious Majesty on high, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.322 - Doctrine and Covenants 20:33     Therefore let the church take heed and pray always, lest they fall into temptation;323 - Doctrine and Covenants 20:37     And again, by way of commandment to the church concerning the manner of baptism--All those who humble themselves before God, and desire to be baptized, and come forth with broken hearts and contrite spirits, and witness before the church that they have truly repented of all their sins, and are willing to take upon them the name of Jesus Christ, having a determination to serve him to the end, and truly manifest by their works that they have received of the Spirit of Christ unto the remission of their sins, shall be received by baptism into his church.324 - Doctrine and Covenants 20:38     The duty of the elders, priests, teachers, deacons, and members of the church of Christ--An apostle is an elder, and it is his calling to baptize;325 - Doctrine and Covenants 20:41     And to confirm those who are baptized into the church, by the laying on of hands for the baptism of fire and the Holy Ghost, according to the scriptures;326 - Doctrine and Covenants 20:42     And to teach, expound, exhort, baptize, and watch over the church;327 - Doctrine and Covenants 20:43     And to confirm the church by the laying on of the hands, and the giving of the Holy Ghost;328 - Doctrine and Covenants 20:53     The teacher's duty is to watch over the church always, and be with and strengthen them;329 - Doctrine and Covenants 20:54     And see that there is no iniquity in the church, neither hardness with each other, neither lying, backbiting, nor evil speaking;330 - Doctrine and Covenants 20:55     And see that the church meet together often, and also see that all the members do their duty.331 - Doctrine and Covenants 20:57     And is to be assisted always, in all his duties in the church, by the deacons, if occasion requires.332 - Doctrine and Covenants 20:61     The several elders composing this church of Christ are to meet in conference once in three months, or from time to time as said conferences shall direct or appoint;333 - Doctrine and Covenants 20:62     And said conferences are to do whatever church business is necessary to be done at the time.334 - Doctrine and Covenants 20:63     The elders are to receive their licenses from other elders, by vote of the church to which they belong, or from the conferences.335 - Doctrine and Covenants 20:65     No person is to be ordained to any office in this church, where there is a regularly organized branch of the same, without the vote of that church;336 - Doctrine and Covenants 20:66     But the presiding elders, traveling bishops, high councilors, high priests, and elders, may have the privilege of ordaining, where there is no branch of the church that a vote may be called.337 - Doctrine and Covenants 20:68     The duty of the members after they are received by baptism--The elders or priests are to have a sufficient time to expound all things concerning the church of Christ to their understanding, previous to their partaking of the sacrament and being confirmed by the laying on of the hands of the elders, so that all things may be done in order.338 - Doctrine and Covenants 20:69     And the members shall manifest before the church, and also before the elders, by a godly walk and conversation, that they are worthy of it, that there may be works and faith agreeable to the holy scriptures--walking in holiness before the Lord.339 - Doctrine and Covenants 20:70     Every member of the church of Christ having children is to bring them unto the elders before the church, who are to lay their hands upon them in the name of Jesus Christ, and bless them in his name.340 - Doctrine and Covenants 20:71     No one can be received into the church of Christ unless he has arrived unto the years of accountability before God, and is capable of repentance.341 - Doctrine and Covenants 20:75     It is expedient that the church meet together often to partake of bread and wine in the remembrance of the Lord Jesus;342 - Doctrine and Covenants 20:76     And the elder or priest shall administer it; and after this manner shall he administer it--he shall kneel with the church and call upon the Father in solemn prayer, saying:343 - Doctrine and Covenants 20:80     Any member of the church of Christ transgressing, or being overtaken in a fault, shall be dealt with as the scriptures direct.344 - Doctrine and Covenants 20:81     It shall be the duty of the several churches, composing the church of Christ, to send one or more of their teachers to attend the several conferences held by the elders of the church,345 - Doctrine and Covenants 20:82     With a list of the names of the several members uniting themselves with the church since the last conference; or send by the hand of some priest; so that a regular list of all the names of the whole church may be kept in a book by one of the elders, whomsoever the other elders shall appoint from time to time;346 - Doctrine and Covenants 20:83     And also, if any have been expelled from the church, so that their names may be blotted out of the general church record of names.347 - Doctrine and Covenants 20:84     All members removing from the church where they reside, if going to a church where they are not known, may take a letter certifying that they are regular members and in good standing, which certificate may be signed by any elder or priest if the member receiving the letter is personally acquainted with the elder or priest, or it may be signed by the teachers or deacons of the church.348 - Doctrine and Covenants 21:1     Behold, there shall be a record kept among you; and in it thou shalt be called a seer, a translator, a prophet, an apostle of Jesus Christ, an elder of the church through the will of God the Father, and the grace of your Lord Jesus Christ,349 - Doctrine and Covenants 21:3     Which church was organized and established in the year of your Lord eighteen hundred and thirty, in the fourth month, and on the sixth day of the month which is called April.350 - Doctrine and Covenants 21:4     Wherefore, meaning the church, thou shalt give heed unto all his words and commandments which he shall give unto you as he receiveth them, walking in all holiness before me;351 - Doctrine and Covenants 21:11     This being an ordinance unto you, that you are an elder under his hand, he being the first unto you, that you might be an elder unto this church of Christ, bearing my name--352 - Doctrine and Covenants 21:12     And the first preacher of this church unto the church, and before the world, yea, before the Gentiles; yea, and thus saith the Lord God, lo, lo! to the Jews also. Amen.353 - Doctrine and Covenants 22:3     For it is because of your dead works that I have caused this last covenant and this church to be built up unto me, even as in days of old.354 - Doctrine and Covenants 23:2     Make known thy calling unto the church, and also before the world, and thy heart shall be opened to preach the truth from henceforth and forever. Amen.355 - Doctrine and Covenants 23:3     Behold, I speak unto you, Hyrum, a few words; for thou also art under no condemnation, and thy heart is opened, and thy tongue loosed; and thy calling is to exhortation, and to strengthen the church continually. Wherefore thy duty is unto the church forever, and this because of thy family. Amen.356 - Doctrine and Covenants 23:4     Behold, I speak a few words unto you, Samuel; for thou also art under no condemnation, and thy calling is to exhortation, and to strengthen the church; and thou art not as yet called to preach before the world. Amen.357 - Doctrine and Covenants 23:5     Behold, I speak a few words unto you, Joseph; for thou also art under no condemnation, and thy calling also is to exhortation, and to strengthen the church; and this is thy duty from henceforth and forever. Amen.358 - Doctrine and Covenants 23:7     And, behold, it is your duty to unite with the true church, and give your language to exhortation continually, that you may receive the reward of the laborer. Amen.359 - Doctrine and Covenants 24:3     Magnify thine office; and after thou hast sowed thy fields and secured them, go speedily unto the church which is in Colesville, Fayette, and Manchester, and they shall support thee; and I will bless them both spiritually and temporally;360 - Doctrine and Covenants 24:5     And thou shalt continue in calling upon God in my name, and writing the things which shall be given thee by the Comforter, and expounding all scriptures unto the church.361 - Doctrine and Covenants 24:9     And in temporal labors thou shalt not have strength, for this is not thy calling. Attend to thy calling and thou shalt have wherewith to magnify thine office, and to expound all scriptures, and continue in laying on of the hands and confirming the churches.362 - Doctrine and Covenants 24:10     And thy brother Oliver shall continue in bearing my name before the world, and also to the church. And he shall not suppose that he can say enough in my cause; and lo, I am with him to the end.363 - Doctrine and Covenants 24:18     And thou shalt take no purse nor scrip, neither staves, neither two coats, for the church shall give unto thee in the very hour what thou needest for food and for raiment, and for shoes and for money, and for scrip.364 - Doctrine and Covenants 25:7     And thou shalt be ordained under his hand to expound scriptures, and to exhort the church, according as it shall be given thee by my Spirit.365 - Doctrine and Covenants 25:9     And thou needest not fear, for thy husband shall support thee in the church; for unto them is his calling, that all things might be revealed unto them, whatsoever I will, according to their faith.366 - Doctrine and Covenants 25:11     And it shall be given thee, also, to make a selection of sacred hymns, as it shall be given thee, which is pleasing unto me, to be had in my church.367 - Doctrine and Covenants 26:1     Behold, I say unto you that you shall let your time be devoted to the studying of the scriptures, and to preaching, and to confirming the church at Colesville, and to performing your labors on the land, such as is required, until after you shall go to the west to hold the next conference; and then it shall be made known what you shall do.368 - Doctrine and Covenants 26:2     And all things shall be done by common consent in the church, by much prayer and faith, for all things you shall receive by faith. Amen.369 - Doctrine and Covenants 28:1     Behold, I say unto thee, Oliver, that it shall be given unto thee that thou shalt be heard by the church in all things whatsoever thou shalt teach them by the Comforter, concerning the revelations and commandments which I have given.370 - Doctrine and Covenants 28:2     But, behold, verily, verily, I say unto thee, no one shall be appointed to receive commandments and revelations in this church excepting my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., for he receiveth them even as Moses.371 - Doctrine and Covenants 28:3     And thou shalt be obedient unto the things which I shall give unto him, even as Aaron, to declare faithfully the commandments and the revelations, with power and authority unto the church.372 - Doctrine and Covenants 28:4     And if thou art led at any time by the Comforter to speak or teach, or at all times by the way of commandment unto the church, thou mayest do it.373 - Doctrine and Covenants 28:6     And thou shalt not command him who is at thy head, and at the head of the church;374 - Doctrine and Covenants 28:8     And now, behold, I say unto you that you shall go unto the Lamanites and preach my gospel unto them; and inasmuch as they receive thy teachings thou shalt cause my church to be established among them; and thou shalt have revelations, but write them not by way of commandment.375 - Doctrine and Covenants 28:12     For, behold, these things have not been appointed unto him, neither shall anything be appointed unto any of this church contrary to the church covenants.376 - Doctrine and Covenants 28:13     For all things must be done in order, and by common consent in the church, by the prayer of faith.377 - Doctrine and Covenants 28:14     And thou shalt assist to settle all these things, according to the covenants of the church, before thou shalt take thy journey among the Lamanites.378 - Doctrine and Covenants 29:21     And the great and abominable church, which is the whore of all the earth, shall be cast down by devouring fire, according as it is spoken by the mouth of Ezekiel the prophet, who spoke of these things, which have not come to pass but surely must, as I live, for abominations shall not reign.379 - Doctrine and Covenants 30:4     And your home shall be at your father's house, until I give unto you further commandments. And you shall attend to the ministry in the church, and before the world, and in the regions round about. Amen.380 - Doctrine and Covenants 30:6     And be you afflicted in all his afflictions, ever lifting up your heart unto me in prayer and faith, for his and your deliverance; for I have given unto him power to build up my church among the Lamanites;381 - Doctrine and Covenants 30:7     And none have I appointed to be his counselor over him in the church, concerning church matters, except it is his brother, Joseph Smith, Jun.382 - Doctrine and Covenants 31:2     Behold, you have had many afflictions because of your family; nevertheless, I will bless you and your family, yea, your little ones; and the day cometh that they will believe and know the truth and be one with you in my church.383 - Doctrine and Covenants 31:7     Yea, I will open the hearts of the people, and they will receive you. And I will establish a church by your hand;384 - Doctrine and Covenants 31:10     Behold, I say unto you that you shall be a physician unto the church, but not unto the world, for they will not receive you.385 - Doctrine and Covenants 33:5     And verily, verily, I say unto you, that this church have I established and called forth out of the wilderness.386 - Doctrine and Covenants 33:13     And upon this rock I will build my church; yea, upon this rock ye are built, and if ye continue, the gates of hell shall not prevail against you.387 - Doctrine and Covenants 33:14     And ye shall remember the church articles and covenants to keep them.388 - Doctrine and Covenants 33:15     And whoso having faith you shall confirm in my church, by the laying on of the hands, and I will bestow the gift of the Holy Ghost upon them.389 - Doctrine and Covenants 36:7     And this commandment shall be given unto the elders of my church, that every man which will embrace it with singleness of heart may be ordained and sent forth, even as I have spoken.390 - Doctrine and Covenants 37:2     And again, I say unto you that ye shall not go until ye have preached my gospel in those parts, and have strengthened up the church whithersoever it is found, and more especially in Colesville; for, behold, they pray unto me in much faith.391 - Doctrine and Covenants 37:3     And again, a commandment I give unto the church, that it is expedient in me that they should assemble together at the Ohio, against the time that my servant Oliver Cowdery shall return unto them.392 - Doctrine and Covenants 38:34     And now, I give unto the church in these parts a commandment, that certain men among them shall be appointed, and they shall be appointed by the voice of the church;393 - Doctrine and Covenants 38:36     And this shall be their work, to govern the affairs of the property of this church.394 - Doctrine and Covenants 38:38     See that all things are preserved; and when men are endowed with power from on high and sent forth, all these things shall be gathered unto the bosom of the church.395 - Doctrine and Covenants 39:13     Thou art called to labor in my vineyard, and to build up my church, and to bring forth Zion, that it may rejoice upon the hills and flourish.396 - Doctrine and Covenants 41:2     Hearken, O ye elders of my church whom I have called, behold I give unto you a commandment, that ye shall assemble yourselves together to agree upon my word;397 - Doctrine and Covenants 41:3     And by the prayer of your faith ye shall receive my law, that ye may know how to govern my church and have all things right before me.398 - Doctrine and Covenants 41:9     And again, I have called my servant Edward Partridge; and I give a commandment, that he should be appointed by the voice of the church, and ordained a bishop unto the church, to leave his merchandise and to spend all his time in the labors of the church;399 - Doctrine and Covenants 42:1     Hearken, O ye elders of my church, who have assembled yourselves together in my name, even Jesus Christ the Son of the living God, the Savior of the world; inasmuch as ye believe on my name and keep my commandments.400 - Doctrine and Covenants 42:8     And from this place ye shall go forth into the regions westward; and inasmuch as ye shall find them that will receive you ye shall build up my church in every region--401 - Doctrine and Covenants 42:11     Again I say unto you, that it shall not be given to any one to go forth to preach my gospel, or to build up my church, except he be ordained by some one who has authority, and it is known to the church that he has authority and has been regularly ordained by the heads of the church.402 - Doctrine and Covenants 42:12     And again, the elders, priests and teachers of this church shall teach the principles of my gospel, which are in the Bible and the Book of Mormon, in the which is the fulness of the gospel.403 - Doctrine and Covenants 42:13     And they shall observe the covenants and church articles to do them, and these shall be their teachings, as they shall be directed by the Spirit.404 - Doctrine and Covenants 42:18     And now, behold, I speak unto the church. Thou shalt not kill; and he that kills shall not have forgiveness in this world, nor in the world to come.405 - Doctrine and Covenants 42:31     And inasmuch as ye impart of your substance unto the poor, ye will do it unto me; and they shall be laid before the bishop of my church and his counselors, two of the elders, or high priests, such as he shall appoint or has appointed and set apart for that purpose.406 - Doctrine and Covenants 42:32     And it shall come to pass, that after they are laid before the bishop of my church, and after that he has received these testimonies concerning the consecration of the properties of my church, that they cannot be taken from the church, agreeable to my commandments, every man shall be made accountable unto me, a steward over his own property, or that which he has received by consecration, as much as is sufficient for himself and family.407 - Doctrine and Covenants 42:33     And again, if there shall be properties in the hands of the church, or any individuals of it, more than is necessary for their support after this first consecration, which is a residue to be consecrated unto the bishop, it shall be kept to administer to those who have not, from time to time, that every man who has need may be amply supplied and receive according to his wants.408 - Doctrine and Covenants 42:34     Therefore, the residue shall be kept in my storehouse, to administer to the poor and the needy, as shall be appointed by the high council of the church, and the bishop and his council;409 - Doctrine and Covenants 42:35     And for the purpose of purchasing lands for the public benefit of the church, and building houses of worship, and building up of the New Jerusalem which is hereafter to be revealed--410 - Doctrine and Covenants 42:37     And it shall come to pass, that he that sinneth and repenteth not shall be cast out of the church, and shall not receive again that which he has consecrated unto the poor and the needy of my church, or in other words, unto me--411 - Doctrine and Covenants 42:44     And the elders of the church, two or more, shall be called, and shall pray for and lay their hands upon them in my name; and if they die they shall die unto me, and if they live they shall live unto me.412 - Doctrine and Covenants 42:59     Thou shalt take the things which thou hast received, which have been given unto thee in my scriptures for a law, to be my law to govern my church;413 - Doctrine and Covenants 42:67     And ye shall hereafter receive church covenants, such as shall be sufficient to establish you, both here and in the New Jerusalem.414 - Doctrine and Covenants 42:69     Lift up your hearts and rejoice, for unto you the kingdom, or in other words, the keys of the church have been given. Even so. Amen.415 - Doctrine and Covenants 42:73     And the bishop, also, shall receive his support, or a just remuneration for all his services in the church.416 - Doctrine and Covenants 42:78     And again, every person who belongeth to this church of Christ, shall observe to keep all the commandments and covenants of the church.417 - Doctrine and Covenants 42:80     And if any man or woman shall commit adultery, he or she shall be tried before two elders of the church, or more, and every word shall be established against him or her by two witnesses of the church, and not of the enemy; but if there are more than two witnesses it is better.418 - Doctrine and Covenants 42:81     But he or she shall be condemned by the mouth of two witnesses; and the elders shall lay the case before the church, and the church shall lift up their hands against him or her, that they may be dealt with according to the law of God.419 - Doctrine and Covenants 42:89     And if he or she confess not thou shalt deliver him or her up unto the church, not to the members, but to the elders. And it shall be done in a meeting, and that not before the world.420 - Doctrine and Covenants 42:92     If any shall offend in secret, he or she shall be rebuked in secret, that he or she may have opportunity to confess in secret to him or her whom he or she has offended, and to God, that the church may not speak reproachfully of him or her.421 - Doctrine and Covenants 43:1     O hearken, ye elders of my church, and give ear to the words which I shall speak unto you.422 - Doctrine and Covenants 43:2     For behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, that ye have received a commandment for a law unto my church, through him whom I have appointed unto you to receive commandments and revelations from my hand.423 - Doctrine and Covenants 43:8     And now, behold, I give unto you a commandment, that when ye are assembled together ye shall instruct and edify each other, that ye may know how to act and direct my church, how to act upon the points of my law and commandments, which I have given.424 - Doctrine and Covenants 43:9     And thus ye shall become instructed in the law of my church, and be sanctified by that which ye have received, and ye shall bind yourselves to act in all holiness before me--425 - Doctrine and Covenants 43:15     Again I say, hearken ye elders of my church, whom I have appointed: Ye are not sent forth to be taught, but to teach the children of men the things which I have put into your hands by the power of my Spirit;426 - Doctrine and Covenants 44:1     Behold, thus saith the Lord unto you my servants, it is expedient in me that the elders of my church should be called together, from the east and from the west, and from the north and from the south, by letter or some other way.427 - Doctrine and Covenants 45:1     Hearken, O ye people of my church, to whom the kingdom has been given; hearken ye and give ear to him who laid the foundation of the earth, who made the heavens and all the hosts thereof, and by whom all things were made which live, and move, and have a being.428 - Doctrine and Covenants 45:6     Hearken, O ye people of my church, and ye elders listen together, and hear my voice while it is called today, and harden not your hearts;429 - Doctrine and Covenants 45:64     Wherefore I, the Lord, have said, gather ye out from the eastern lands, assemble ye yourselves together ye elders of my church; go ye forth into the western countries, call upon the inhabitants to repent, and inasmuch as they do repent, build up churches unto me.430 - Doctrine and Covenants 46:1     Hearken, O ye people of my church; for verily I say unto you that these things were spoken unto you for your profit and learning.431 - Doctrine and Covenants 46:2     But notwithstanding those things which are written, it always has been given to the elders of my church from the beginning, and ever shall be, to conduct all meetings as they are directed and guided by the Holy Spirit.432 - Doctrine and Covenants 46:4     Ye are also commanded not to cast any one who belongeth to the church out of your sacrament meetings; nevertheless, if any have trespassed, let him not partake until he makes reconciliation.433 - Doctrine and Covenants 46:5     And again I say unto you, ye shall not cast any out of your sacrament meetings who are earnestly seeking the kingdom--I speak this concerning those who are not of the church.434 - Doctrine and Covenants 46:6     And again I say unto you, concerning your confirmation meetings, that if there be any that are not of the church, that are earnestly seeking after the kingdom, ye shall not cast them out.435 - Doctrine and Covenants 46:10     And again, verily I say unto you, I would that ye should always remember, and always retain in your minds what those gifts are, that are given unto the church.436 - Doctrine and Covenants 46:27     And unto the bishop of the church, and unto such as God shall appoint and ordain to watch over the church and to be elders unto the church, are to have it given unto them to discern all those gifts lest there shall be any among you professing and yet be not of God.437 - Doctrine and Covenants 47:3     And again, I say unto you that it shall be appointed unto him to keep the church record and history continually; for Oliver Cowdery I have appointed to another office.438 - Doctrine and Covenants 48:6     And they shall be appointed to purchase the lands, and to make a commencement to lay the foundation of the city; and then shall ye begin to be gathered with your families, every man according to his family, according to his circumstances, and as is appointed to him by the presidency and the bishop of the church, according to the laws and commandments which ye have received, and which ye shall hereafter receive. Even so. Amen.439 - Doctrine and Covenants 49:14     And whoso doeth this shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, by the laying on of the hands of the elders of the church.440 - Doctrine and Covenants 50:1     Hearken, O ye elders of my church, and give ear to the voice of the living God; and attend to the words of wisdom which shall be given unto you, according as ye have asked and are agreed as touching the church, and the spirits which have gone abroad in the earth.441 - Doctrine and Covenants 50:4     Behold, I, the Lord, have looked upon you, and have seen abominations in the church that profess my name.442 - Doctrine and Covenants 50:8     But the hypocrites shall be detected and shall be cut off, either in life or in death, even as I will; and wo unto them who are cut off from my church, for the same are overcome of the world.443 - Doctrine and Covenants 50:10     And now come, saith the Lord, by the Spirit, unto the elders of his church, and let us reason together, that ye may understand;444 - Doctrine and Covenants 50:37     Let my servant Joseph Wakefield, in whom I am well pleased, and my servant Parley P. Pratt go forth among the churches and strengthen them by the word of exhortation;445 - Doctrine and Covenants 51:4     And let my servant Edward Partridge, when he shall appoint a man his portion, give unto him a writing that shall secure unto him his portion, that he shall hold it, even this right and this inheritance in the church, until he transgresses and is not accounted worthy by the voice of the church, according to the laws and covenants of the church, to belong to the church.446 - Doctrine and Covenants 51:5     And if he shall transgress and is not accounted worthy to belong to the church, he shall not have power to claim that portion which he has consecrated unto the bishop for the poor and needy of my church; therefore, he shall not retain the gift, but shall only have claim on that portion that is deeded unto him.447 - Doctrine and Covenants 51:10     And let that which belongeth to this people not be taken and given unto that of another church.448 - Doctrine and Covenants 51:11     Wherefore, if another church would receive money of this church, let them pay unto this church again according as they shall agree;449 - Doctrine and Covenants 51:12     And this shall be done through the bishop or the agent, which shall be appointed by the voice of the church.450 - Doctrine and Covenants 51:13     And again, let the bishop appoint a storehouse unto this church; and let all things both in money and in meat, which are more than is needful for the wants of this people, be kept in the hands of the bishop.451 - Doctrine and Covenants 51:18     Behold, this shall be an example unto my servant Edward Partridge, in other places, in all churches.452 - Doctrine and Covenants 52:39     Let the residue of the elders watch over the churches, and declare the word in the regions round about them; and let them labor with their own hands that there be no idolatry nor wickedness practiced.453 - Doctrine and Covenants 52:41     And again, let my servants Joseph Smith, Jun., and Sidney Rigdon and Edward Partridge take with them a recommend from the church. And let there be one obtained for my servant Oliver Cowdery also.454 - Doctrine and Covenants 53:1     Behold, I say unto you, my servant Sidney Gilbert, that I have heard your prayers; and you have called upon me that it should be made known unto you, of the Lord your God, concerning your calling and election in the church, which I, the Lord, have raised up in these last days.455 - Doctrine and Covenants 53:4     And also to be an agent unto this church in the place which shall be appointed by the bishop, according to commandments which shall be given hereafter.456 - Doctrine and Covenants 55:2     And then thou shalt be ordained by the hand of my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., to be an elder unto this church, to preach repentance and remission of sins by way of baptism in the name of Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God.457 - Doctrine and Covenants 55:4     And again, you shall be ordained to assist my servant Oliver Cowdery to do the work of printing, and of selecting and writing books for schools in this church, that little children also may receive instruction before me as is pleasing unto me.458 - Doctrine and Covenants 56:10     Otherwise he shall receive the money which he has paid, and shall leave the place, and shall be cut off out of my church, saith the Lord God of hosts;459 - Doctrine and Covenants 57:1     Hearken, O ye elders of my church, saith the Lord your God, who have assembled yourselves together, according to my commandments, in this land, which is the land of Missouri, which is the land which I have appointed and consecrated for the gathering of the saints.460 - Doctrine and Covenants 57:6     And let my servant Sidney Gilbert stand in the office to which I have appointed him, to receive moneys, to be an agent unto the church, to buy land in all the regions round about, inasmuch as can be done in righteousness, and as wisdom shall direct.461 - Doctrine and Covenants 57:11     And again, verily I say unto you, let my servant William W. Phelps be planted in this place, and be established as a printer unto the church.462 - Doctrine and Covenants 58:1     Hearken, O ye elders of my church, and give ear to my word, and learn of me what I will concerning you, and also concerning this land unto which I have sent you.463 - Doctrine and Covenants 58:23     Behold, the laws which ye have received from my hand are the laws of the church, and in this light ye shall hold them forth. Behold, here is wisdom.464 - Doctrine and Covenants 58:35     It is wisdom in me that my servant Martin Harris should be an example unto the church, in laying his moneys before the bishop of the church.465 - Doctrine and Covenants 58:44     And now, verily, I say concerning the residue of the elders of my church, the time has not yet come, for many years, for them to receive their inheritance in this land, except they desire it through the prayer of faith, only as it shall be appointed unto them of the Lord.466 - Doctrine and Covenants 58:48     And let them build up churches, inasmuch as the inhabitants of the earth will repent.467 - Doctrine and Covenants 58:49     And let there be an agent appointed by the voice of the church, unto the church in Ohio, to receive moneys to purchase lands in Zion.468 - Doctrine and Covenants 58:51     And an epistle and subscription, to be presented unto all the churches to obtain moneys, to be put into the hands of the bishop, of himself or the agent, as seemeth him good or as he shall direct, to purchase lands for an inheritance for the children of God.469 - Doctrine and Covenants 58:55     Let all these things be done in order; and let the privileges of the lands be made known from time to time, by the bishop or the agent of the church.470 - Doctrine and Covenants 58:56     And let the work of the gathering be not in haste, nor by flight; but let it be done as it shall be counseled by the elders of the church at the conferences, according to the knowledge which they receive from time to time.471 - Doctrine and Covenants 58:60     Let that which has been bestowed upon Ziba Peterson be taken from him; and let him stand as a member in the church, and labor with his own hands, with the brethren, until he is sufficiently chastened for all his sins; for he confesseth them not, and he thinketh to hide them.472 - Doctrine and Covenants 58:61     Let the residue of the elders of this church, who are coming to this land, some of whom are exceedingly blessed even above measure, also hold a conference upon this land.473 - Doctrine and Covenants 60:1     Behold, thus saith the Lord unto the elders of his church, who are to return speedily to the land from whence they came: Behold, it pleaseth me, that you have come up hither;474 - Doctrine and Covenants 60:8     And let the residue take their journey from St. Louis, two by two, and preach the word, not in haste, among the congregations of the wicked, until they return to the churches from whence they came.475 - Doctrine and Covenants 60:9     And all this for the good of the churches; for this intent have I sent them.476 - Doctrine and Covenants 61:2     Behold, verily thus saith the Lord unto you, O ye elders of my church, who are assembled upon this spot, whose sins are now forgiven you, for I, the Lord, forgive sins, and am merciful unto those who confess their sins with humble hearts;477 - Doctrine and Covenants 62:1     Behold, and hearken, O ye elders of my church, saith the Lord your God, even Jesus Christ, your advocate, who knoweth the weakness of man and how to succor them who are tempted.478 - Doctrine and Covenants 63:46     And now speedily visit the churches, expounding these things unto them, with my servant Oliver Cowdery. Behold, this is my will, obtaining moneys even as I have directed.479 - Doctrine and Covenants 63:63     Wherefore, let the church repent of their sins, and I, the Lord, will own them; otherwise they shall be cut off.480 - Doctrine and Covenants 64:1     Behold, thus saith the Lord your God unto you, O ye elders of my church, hearken ye and hear, and receive my will concerning you.481 - Doctrine and Covenants 64:12     And him that repenteth not of his sins, and confesseth them not, ye shall bring before the church, and do with him as the scripture saith unto you, either by commandment or by revelation.482 - Doctrine and Covenants 64:26     And it is not meet that my servants, Newel K. Whitney and Sidney Gilbert, should sell their store and their possessions here; for this is not wisdom until the residue of the church, which remaineth in this place, shall go up unto the land of Zion.483 - Doctrine and Covenants 64:37     Behold, I, the Lord, have made my church in these last days like unto a judge sitting on a hill, or in a high place, to judge the nations.484 - Doctrine and Covenants 67:1     Behold and hearken, O ye elders of my church, who have assembled yourselves together, whose prayers I have heard, and whose hearts I know, and whose desires have come up before me.485 - Doctrine and Covenants 68:7     This is the word of the Lord unto you, my servant Orson Hyde, and also unto my servant Luke Johnson, and unto my servant Lyman Johnson, and unto my servant William E. McLellin, and unto all the faithful elders of my church--486 - Doctrine and Covenants 68:14     There remain hereafter, in the due time of the Lord, other bishops to be set apart unto the church, to minister even according to the first;487 - Doctrine and Covenants 68:22     And again, no bishop or high priest who shall be set apart for this ministry shall be tried or condemned for any crime, save it be before the First Presidency of the church;488 - Doctrine and Covenants 68:24     And if he repent he shall be forgiven, according to the covenants and commandments of the church.489 - Doctrine and Covenants 69:3     And also that he shall continue in writing and making a history of all the important things which he shall observe and know concerning my church;490 - Doctrine and Covenants 69:7     Nevertheless, let my servant John Whitmer travel many times from place to place, and from church to church, that he may the more easily obtain knowledge--491 - Doctrine and Covenants 69:8     Preaching and expounding, writing, copying, selecting, and obtaining all things which shall be for the good of the church, and for the rising generations that shall grow up on the land of Zion, to possess it from generation to generation, forever and ever. Amen.492 - Doctrine and Covenants 70:1     Behold, and hearken, O ye inhabitants of Zion, and all ye people of my church who are afar off, and hear the word of the Lord which I give unto my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and also unto my servant Martin Harris, and also unto my servant Oliver Cowdery, and also unto my servant John Whitmer, and also unto my servant Sidney Rigdon, and also unto my servant William W. Phelps, by the way of commandment unto them.493 - Doctrine and Covenants 70:5     Wherefore, I have appointed unto them, and this is their business in the church of God, to manage them and the concerns thereof, yea, the benefits thereof.494 - Doctrine and Covenants 70:6     Wherefore, a commandment I give unto them, that they shall not give these things unto the church, neither unto the world;495 - Doctrine and Covenants 70:10     And behold, none are exempt from this law who belong to the church of the living God;496 - Doctrine and Covenants 71:2     Verily I say unto you, proclaim unto the world in the regions round about, and in the church also, for the space of a season, even until it shall be made known unto you.497 - Doctrine and Covenants 72:1     Hearken, and listen to the voice of the Lord, O ye who have assembled yourselves together, who are the high priests of my church, to whom the kingdom and power have been given.498 - Doctrine and Covenants 72:2     For verily thus saith the Lord, it is expedient in me for a bishop to be appointed unto you, or of you, unto the church in this part of the Lord's vineyard.499 - Doctrine and Covenants 72:5     Verily I say unto you, the elders of the church in this part of my vineyard shall render an account of their stewardship unto the bishop, who shall be appointed of me in this part of my vineyard.500 - Doctrine and Covenants 72:9     The word of the Lord, in addition to the law which has been given, making known the duty of the bishop who has been ordained unto the church in this part of the vineyard, which is verily this--501 - Doctrine and Covenants 72:10     To keep the Lord's storehouse; to receive the funds of the church in this part of the vineyard;502 - Doctrine and Covenants 72:12     That this also may be consecrated to the good of the church, to the poor and needy.503 - Doctrine and Covenants 72:14     And the labors of the faithful who labor in spiritual things, in administering the gospel and the things of the kingdom unto the church, and unto the world, shall answer the debt unto the bishop in Zion;504 - Doctrine and Covenants 72:15     Thus it cometh out of the church, for according to the law every man that cometh up to Zion must lay all things before the bishop in Zion.505 - Doctrine and Covenants 72:19     And now, verily I say unto you, let every elder who shall give an account unto the bishop of the church in this part of the vineyard be recommended by the church or churches, in which he labors, that he may render himself and his accounts approved in all things.506 - Doctrine and Covenants 72:20     And again, let my servants who are appointed as stewards over the literary concerns of my church have claim for assistance upon the bishop or bishops in all things--507 - Doctrine and Covenants 72:21     That the revelations may be published, and go forth unto the ends of the earth; that they also may obtain funds which shall benefit the church in all things;508 - Doctrine and Covenants 72:23     And now, behold, this shall be an ensample for all the extensive branches of my church, in whatsoever land they shall be established. And now I make an end of my sayings. Amen.509 - Doctrine and Covenants 72:24     A few words in addition to the laws of the kingdom, respecting the members of the church--they that are appointed by the Holy Spirit to go up unto Zion, and they who are privileged to go up unto Zion--510 - Doctrine and Covenants 72:25     Let them carry up unto the bishop a certificate from three elders of the church, or a certificate from the bishop;511 - Doctrine and Covenants 73:1     For verily, thus saith the Lord, it is expedient in me that they should continue preaching the gospel, and in exhortation to the churches in the regions round about, until conference;512 - Doctrine and Covenants 74:5     Wherefore, for this cause the apostle wrote unto the church, giving unto them a commandment, not of the Lord, but of himself, that a believer should not be united to an unbeliever; except the law of Moses should be done away among them,513 - Doctrine and Covenants 75:23     And again, thus saith the Lord unto you, O ye elders of my church, who have given your names that you might know his will concerning you--514 - Doctrine and Covenants 75:24     Behold, I say unto you, that it is the duty of the church to assist in supporting the families of those, and also to support the families of those who are called and must needs be sent unto the world to proclaim the gospel unto the world.515 - Doctrine and Covenants 75:26     And let all such as can obtain places for their families, and support of the church for them, not fail to go into the world, whether to the east or to the west, or to the north, or to the south.516 - Doctrine and Covenants 75:28     And again, verily I say unto you, that every man who is obliged to provide for his own family, let him provide, and he shall in nowise lose his crown; and let him labor in the church.517 - Doctrine and Covenants 75:29     Let every man be diligent in all things. And the idler shall not have place in the church, except he repent and mend his ways.518 - Doctrine and Covenants 76:54     They are they who are the church of the Firstborn.519 - Doctrine and Covenants 76:67     These are they who have come to an innumerable company of angels, to the general assembly and church of Enoch, and of the Firstborn.520 - Doctrine and Covenants 76:71     And again, we saw the terrestrial world, and behold and lo, these are they who are of the terrestrial, whose glory differs from that of the church of the Firstborn who have received the fulness of the Father, even as that of the moon differs from the sun in the firmament.521 - Doctrine and Covenants 76:94     They who dwell in his presence are the church of the Firstborn; and they see as they are seen, and know as they are known, having received of his fulness and of his grace;522 - Doctrine and Covenants 76:102     Last of all, these all are they who will not be gathered with the saints, to be caught up unto the church of the Firstborn, and received into the cloud.523 - Doctrine and Covenants 77:5     Q. What are we to understand by the four and twenty elders, spoken of by John? A. We are to understand that these elders whom John saw, were elders who had been faithful in the work of the ministry and were dead; who belonged to the seven churches, and were then in the paradise of God.524 - Doctrine and Covenants 77:11     Q. What are we to understand by sealing the one hundred and forty-four thousand, out of all the tribes of Israel--twelve thousand out of every tribe? A. We are to understand that those who are sealed are high priests, ordained unto the holy order of God, to administer the everlasting gospel; for they are they who are ordained out of every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, by the angels to whom is given power over the nations of the earth, to bring as many as will come to the church of the Firstborn.525 - Doctrine and Covenants 78:1     The Lord spake unto Joseph Smith, Jun., saying: Hearken unto me, saith the Lord your God, who are ordained unto the high priesthood of my church, who have assembled yourselves together;526 - Doctrine and Covenants 78:4     For a permanent and everlasting establishment and order unto my church, to advance the cause, which ye have espoused, to the salvation of man, and to the glory of your Father who is in heaven;527 - Doctrine and Covenants 78:12     And he who breaketh it shall lose his office and standing in the church, and shall be delivered over to the buffetings of Satan until the day of redemption.528 - Doctrine and Covenants 78:14     That through my providence, notwithstanding the tribulation which shall descend upon you, that the church may stand independent above all other creatures beneath the celestial world;529 - Doctrine and Covenants 78:21     For ye are the church of the Firstborn, and he will take you up in a cloud, and appoint every man his portion.530 - Doctrine and Covenants 81:1     Verily, verily, I say unto you my servant Frederick G. Williams: Listen to the voice of him who speaketh, to the word of the Lord your God, and hearken to the calling wherewith you are called, even to be a high priest in my church, and a counselor unto my servant Joseph Smith, Jun.;531 - Doctrine and Covenants 82:18     And all this for the benefit of the church of the living God, that every man may improve upon his talent, that every man may gain other talents, yea, even an hundred fold, to be cast into the Lord's storehouse, to become the common property of the whole church--532 - Doctrine and Covenants 82:21     And the soul that sins against this covenant, and hardeneth his heart against it, shall be dealt with according to the laws of my church, and shall be delivered over to the buffetings of Satan until the day of redemption.533 - Doctrine and Covenants 83:1     Verily, thus saith the Lord, in addition to the laws of the church concerning women and children, those who belong to the church, who have lost their husbands or fathers:534 - Doctrine and Covenants 83:2     Women have claim on their husbands for their maintenance, until their husbands are taken; and if they are not found transgressors they shall have fellowship in the church.535 - Doctrine and Covenants 83:3     And if they are not faithful they shall not have fellowship in the church; yet they may remain upon their inheritances according to the laws of the land.536 - Doctrine and Covenants 83:5     And after that, they have claim upon the church, or in other words upon the Lord's storehouse, if their parents have not wherewith to give them inheritances.537 - Doctrine and Covenants 83:6     And the storehouse shall be kept by the consecrations of the church; and widows and orphans shall be provided for, as also the poor. Amen.538 - Doctrine and Covenants 84:2     Yea, the word of the Lord concerning his church, established in the last days for the restoration of his people, as he has spoken by the mouth of his prophets, and for the gathering of his saints to stand upon Mount Zion, which shall be the city of New Jerusalem.539 - Doctrine and Covenants 84:17     Which priesthood continueth in the church of God in all generations, and is without beginning of days or end of years.540 - Doctrine and Covenants 84:32     And the sons of Moses and of Aaron shall be filled with the glory of the Lord, upon Mount Zion in the Lord's house, whose sons are ye; and also many whom I have called and sent forth to build up my church.541 - Doctrine and Covenants 84:34     They become the sons of Moses and of Aaron and the seed of Abraham, and the church and kingdom, and the elect of God.542 - Doctrine and Covenants 84:55     Which vanity and unbelief have brought the whole church under condemnation.543 - Doctrine and Covenants 84:86     Therefore, let no man among you, for this commandment is unto all the faithful who are called of God in the church unto the ministry, from this hour take purse or scrip, that goeth forth to proclaim this gospel of the kingdom.544 - Doctrine and Covenants 84:108     Behold, this is the way that mine apostles, in ancient days, built up my church unto me.545 - Doctrine and Covenants 84:111     And behold, the high priests should travel, and also the elders, and also the lesser priests; but the deacons and teachers should be appointed to watch over the church, to be standing ministers unto the church.546 - Doctrine and Covenants 84:112     And the bishop, Newel K. Whitney, also should travel round about and among all the churches, searching after the poor to administer to their wants by humbling the rich and the proud.547 - Doctrine and Covenants 85:1     It is the duty of the Lord's clerk, whom he has appointed, to keep a history, and a general church record of all things that transpire in Zion, and of all those who consecrate properties, and receive inheritances legally from the bishop;548 - Doctrine and Covenants 85:4     Neither is their genealogy to be kept, or to be had where it may be found on any of the records or history of the church.549 - Doctrine and Covenants 85:11     And they who are of the High Priesthood, whose names are not found written in the book of the law, or that are found to have apostatized, or to have been cut off from the church, as well as the lesser priesthood, or the members, in that day shall not find an inheritance among the saints of the Most High;550 - Doctrine and Covenants 86:3     And after they have fallen asleep the great persecutor of the church, the apostate, the whore, even Babylon, that maketh all nations to drink of her cup, in whose hearts the enemy, even Satan, sitteth to reign--behold he soweth the tares; wherefore, the tares choke the wheat and drive the church into the wilderness.551 - Doctrine and Covenants 88:5     Which glory is that of the church of the Firstborn, even of God, the holiest of all, through Jesus Christ his Son--552 - Doctrine and Covenants 88:94     And another angel shall sound his trump, saying: That great church, the mother of abominations, that made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, that persecuteth the saints of God, that shed their blood--she who sitteth upon many waters, and upon the islands of the sea--behold, she is the tares of the earth; she is bound in bundles; her bands are made strong, no man can loose them; therefore, she is ready to be burned. And he shall sound his trump both long and loud, and all nations shall hear it.553 - Doctrine and Covenants 88:127     And again, the order of the house prepared for the presidency of the school of the prophets, established for their instruction in all things that are expedient for them, even for all the officers of the church, or in other words, those who are called to the ministry in the church, beginning at the high priests, even down to the deacons--554 - Doctrine and Covenants 88:140     And again, the ordinance of washing feet is to be administered by the president, or presiding elder of the church.555 - Doctrine and Covenants 89:1     A Word of Wisdom, for the benefit of the council of high priests, assembled in Kirtland, and the church, and also the saints in Zion--556 - Doctrine and Covenants 90:4     Nevertheless, through you shall the oracles be given to another, yea, even unto the church.557 - Doctrine and Covenants 90:13     And when you have finished the translation of the prophets, you shall from thenceforth preside over the affairs of the church and the school;558 - Doctrine and Covenants 90:15     And set in order the churches, and study and learn, and become acquainted with all good books, and with languages, tongues, and people.559 - Doctrine and Covenants 90:16     And this shall be your business and mission in all your lives, to preside in council, and set in order all the affairs of this church and kingdom.560 - Doctrine and Covenants 93:22     And all those who are begotten through me are partakers of the glory of the same, and are the church of the Firstborn.561 - Doctrine and Covenants 93:50     My servant Newel K. Whitney also, a bishop of my church, hath need to be chastened, and set in order his family, and see that they are more diligent and concerned at home, and pray always, or they shall be removed out of their place.562 - Doctrine and Covenants 94:3     And let the first lot on the south be consecrated unto me for the building of a house for the presidency, for the work of the presidency, in obtaining revelations; and for the work of the ministry of the presidency, in all things pertaining to the church and kingdom.563 - Doctrine and Covenants 97:5     And I will bless him with a multiplicity of blessings, in expounding all scriptures and mysteries to the edification of the school, and of the church in Zion.564 - Doctrine and Covenants 98:6     Therefore, I, the Lord, justify you, and your brethren of my church, in befriending that law which is the constitutional law of the land;565 - Doctrine and Covenants 98:19     Behold, I, the Lord, am not well pleased with many who are in the church at Kirtland;566 - Doctrine and Covenants 100:15     Therefore, let your hearts be comforted; for all things shall work together for good to them that walk uprightly, and to the sanctification of the church.567 - Doctrine and Covenants 101:63     Again, verily I say unto you, I will show unto you wisdom in me concerning all the churches, inasmuch as they are willing to be guided in a right and proper way for their salvation--568 - Doctrine and Covenants 101:67     Therefore, a commandment I give unto all the churches, that they shall continue to gather together unto the places which I have appointed.569 - Doctrine and Covenants 101:72     Now, verily I say unto you, let all the churches gather together all their moneys; let these things be done in their time, but not in haste; and observe to have all things prepared before you.570 - Doctrine and Covenants 101:74     And the churches in the eastern countries, when they are built up, if they will hearken unto this counsel they may buy lands and gather together upon them; and in this way they may establish Zion.571 - Doctrine and Covenants 101:75     There is even now already in store sufficient, yea, even an abundance, to redeem Zion, and establish her waste places, no more to be thrown down, were the churches, who call themselves after my name, willing to hearken to my voice.572 - Doctrine and Covenants 102:1     This day a general council of twenty-four high priests assembled at the house of Joseph Smith, Jun., by revelation, and proceeded to organize the high council of the church of Christ, which was to consist of twelve high priests, and one or three presidents as the case might require.573 - Doctrine and Covenants 102:2     The high council was appointed by revelation for the purpose of settling important difficulties which might arise in the church, which could not be settled by the church or the bishop's council to the satisfaction of the parties.574 - Doctrine and Covenants 102:3     Joseph Smith, Jun., Sidney Rigdon and Frederick G. Williams were acknowledged presidents by the voice of the council; and Joseph Smith, Sen., John Smith, Joseph Coe, John Johnson, Martin Harris, John S. Carter, Jared Carter, Oliver Cowdery, Samuel H. Smith, Orson Hyde, Sylvester Smith, and Luke Johnson, high priests, were chosen to be a standing council for the church, by the unanimous voice of the council.575 - Doctrine and Covenants 102:5     The number composing the council, who voted in the name and for the church in appointing the above-named councilors were forty-three, as follows: nine high priests, seventeen elders, four priests, and thirteen members.576 - Doctrine and Covenants 102:8     Voted: that whenever any vacancy shall occur by the death, removal from office for transgression, or removal from the bounds of this church government, of any one of the above-named councilors, it shall be filled by the nomination of the president or presidents, and sanctioned by the voice of a general council of high priests, convened for that purpose, to act in the name of the church.577 - Doctrine and Covenants 102:9     The president of the church, who is also the president of the council, is appointed by revelation, and acknowledged in his administration by the voice of the church.578 - Doctrine and Covenants 102:10     And it is according to the dignity of his office that he should preside over the council of the church; and it is his privilege to be assisted by two other presidents, appointed after the same manner that he himself was appointed.579 - Doctrine and Covenants 102:12     Whenever a high council of the church of Christ is regularly organized, according to the foregoing pattern, it shall be the duty of the twelve councilors to cast lots by numbers, and thereby ascertain who of the twelve shall speak first, commencing with number one and so in succession to number twelve.580 - Doctrine and Covenants 102:26     It shall be the duty of said council to transmit, immediately, a copy of their proceedings, with a full statement of the testimony accompanying their decision, to the high council of the seat of the First Presidency of the Church.581 - Doctrine and Covenants 102:27     Should the parties or either of them be dissatisfied with the decision of said council, they may appeal to the high council of the seat of the First Presidency of the Church, and have a re-hearing, which case shall there be conducted, according to the former pattern written, as though no such decision had been made.582 - Doctrine and Covenants 102:28     This council of high priests abroad is only to be called on the most difficult cases of church matters; and no common or ordinary case is to be sufficient to call such council.583 - Doctrine and Covenants 102:32     The latter can only be called in question by the general authorities of the church in case of transgression.584 - Doctrine and Covenants 102:33     Resolved: that the president or presidents of the seat of the First Presidency of the Church shall have power to determine whether any such case, as may be appealed, is justly entitled to a re-hearing, after examining the appeal and the evidences and statements accompanying it.585 - Doctrine and Covenants 103:23     And let all the churches send up wise men with their moneys, and purchase lands even as I have commanded them.586 - Doctrine and Covenants 103:29     It is my will that my servant Sidney Rigdon shall lift up his voice in the congregations in the eastern countries, in preparing the churches to keep the commandments which I have given unto them concerning the restoration and redemption of Zion.587 - Doctrine and Covenants 104:1     Verily I say unto you, my friends, I give unto you counsel, and a commandment, concerning all the properties which belong to the order which I commanded to be organized and established, to be a united order, and an everlasting order for the benefit of my church, and for the salvation of men until I come--588 - Doctrine and Covenants 104:59     For the purpose of building up my church and kingdom on the earth, and to prepare my people for the time when I shall dwell with them, which is nigh at hand.589 - Doctrine and Covenants 105:2     Behold, I say unto you, were it not for the transgressions of my people, speaking concerning the church and not individuals, they might have been redeemed even now.590 - Doctrine and Covenants 105:7     I speak not concerning those who are appointed to lead my people, who are the first elders of my church, for they are not all under this condemnation;591 - Doctrine and Covenants 105:8     But I speak concerning my churches abroad--there are many who will say: Where is their God? Behold, he will deliver them in time of trouble, otherwise we will not go up unto Zion, and will keep our moneys.592 - Doctrine and Covenants 105:33     Verily I say unto you, it is expedient in me that the first elders of my church should receive their endowment from on high in my house, which I have commanded to be built unto my name in the land of Kirtland.593 - Doctrine and Covenants 106:1     It is my will that my servant Warren A. Cowdery should be appointed and ordained a presiding high priest over my church, in the land of Freedom and the regions round about;594 - Doctrine and Covenants 106:8     And I will give him grace and assurance wherewith he may stand; and if he continue to be a faithful witness and a light unto the church I have prepared a crown for him in the mansions of my Father. Even so. Amen.595 - Doctrine and Covenants 107:1     There are, in the church, two priesthoods, namely, the Melchizedek and Aaronic, including the Levitical Priesthood.596 - Doctrine and Covenants 107:4     But out of respect or reverence to the name of the Supreme Being, to avoid the too frequent repetition of his name, they, the church, in ancient days, called that priesthood after Melchizedek, or the Melchizedek Priesthood.597 - Doctrine and Covenants 107:5     All other authorities or offices in the church are appendages to this priesthood.598 - Doctrine and Covenants 107:8     The Melchizedek Priesthood holds the right of presidency, and has power and authority over all the offices in the church in all ages of the world, to administer in spiritual things.599 - Doctrine and Covenants 107:9     The Presidency of the High Priesthood, after the order of Melchizedek, have a right to officiate in all the offices in the church.600 - Doctrine and Covenants 107:12     The high priest and elder are to administer in spiritual things, agreeable to the covenants and commandments of the church; and they have a right to officiate in all these offices of the church when there are no higher authorities present.601 - Doctrine and Covenants 107:18     The power and authority of the higher, or Melchizedek Priesthood, is to hold the keys of all the spiritual blessings of the church--602 - Doctrine and Covenants 107:19     To have the privilege of receiving the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, to have the heavens opened unto them, to commune with the general assembly and church of the Firstborn, and to enjoy the communion and presence of God the Father, and Jesus the mediator of the new covenant.603 - Doctrine and Covenants 107:22     Of the Melchizedek Priesthood, three Presiding High Priests, chosen by the body, appointed and ordained to that office, and upheld by the confidence, faith, and prayer of the church, form a quorum of the Presidency of the Church.604 - Doctrine and Covenants 107:23     The twelve traveling councilors are called to be the Twelve Apostles, or special witnesses of the name of Christ in all the world--thus differing from other officers in the church in the duties of their calling.605 - Doctrine and Covenants 107:25     The Seventy are also called to preach the gospel, and to be especial witnesses unto the Gentiles and in all the world--thus differing from other officers in the church in the duties of their calling.606 - Doctrine and Covenants 107:32     And in case that any decision of these quorums is made in unrighteousness, it may be brought before a general assembly of the several quorums, which constitute the spiritual authorities of the church; otherwise there can be no appeal from their decision.607 - Doctrine and Covenants 107:33     The Twelve are a Traveling Presiding High Council, to officiate in the name of the Lord, under the direction of the Presidency of the Church, agreeable to the institution of heaven; to build up the church, and regulate all the affairs of the same in all nations, first unto the Gentiles and secondly unto the Jews.608 - Doctrine and Covenants 107:34     The Seventy are to act in the name of the Lord, under the direction of the Twelve or the traveling high council, in building up the church and regulating all the affairs of the same in all nations, first unto the Gentiles and then to the Jews--609 - Doctrine and Covenants 107:36     The standing high councils, at the stakes of Zion, form a quorum equal in authority in the affairs of the church, in all their decisions, to the quorum of the presidency, or to the traveling high council.610 - Doctrine and Covenants 107:37     The high council in Zion form a quorum equal in authority in the affairs of the church, in all their decisions, to the councils of the Twelve at the stakes of Zion.611 - Doctrine and Covenants 107:39     It is the duty of the Twelve, in all large branches of the church, to ordain evangelical ministers, as they shall be designated unto them by revelation--612 - Doctrine and Covenants 107:58     It is the duty of the Twelve, also, to ordain and set in order all the other officers of the church, agreeable to the revelation which says:613 - Doctrine and Covenants 107:59     To the church of Christ in the land of Zion, in addition to the church laws respecting church business--614 - Doctrine and Covenants 107:63     Wherefore, from deacon to teacher, and from teacher to priest, and from priest to elder, severally as they are appointed, according to the covenants and commandments of the church.615 - Doctrine and Covenants 107:65     Wherefore, it must needs be that one be appointed of the High Priesthood to preside over the priesthood, and he shall be called President of the High Priesthood of the Church;616 - Doctrine and Covenants 107:66     Or, in other words, the Presiding High Priest over the High Priesthood of the Church.617 - Doctrine and Covenants 107:67     From the same comes the administering of ordinances and blessings upon the church, by the laying on of the hands.618 - Doctrine and Covenants 107:72     And also to be a judge in Israel, to do the business of the church, to sit in judgment upon transgressors upon testimony as it shall be laid before him according to the laws, by the assistance of his counselors, whom he has chosen or will choose among the elders of the church.619 - Doctrine and Covenants 107:74     Thus shall he be a judge, even a common judge among the inhabitants of Zion, or in a stake of Zion, or in any branch of the church where he shall be set apart unto this ministry, until the borders of Zion are enlarged and it becomes necessary to have other bishops or judges in Zion or elsewhere.620 - Doctrine and Covenants 107:78     Again, verily, I say unto you, the most important business of the church, and the most difficult cases of the church, inasmuch as there is not satisfaction upon the decision of the bishop or judges, it shall be handed over and carried up unto the council of the church, before the Presidency of the High Priesthood.621 - Doctrine and Covenants 107:79     And the Presidency of the council of the High Priesthood shall have power to call other high priests, even twelve, to assist as counselors; and thus the Presidency of the High Priesthood and its counselors shall have power to decide upon testimony according to the laws of the church.622 - Doctrine and Covenants 107:80     And after this decision it shall be had in remembrance no more before the Lord; for this is the highest council of the church of God, and a final decision upon controversies in spiritual matters.623 - Doctrine and Covenants 107:81     There is not any person belonging to the church who is exempt from this council of the church.624 - Doctrine and Covenants 107:82     And inasmuch as a President of the High Priesthood shall transgress, he shall be had in remembrance before the common council of the church, who shall be assisted by twelve counselors of the High Priesthood;625 - Doctrine and Covenants 107:91     And again, the duty of the President of the office of the High Priesthood is to preside over the whole church, and to be like unto Moses--626 - Doctrine and Covenants 107:92     Behold, here is wisdom; yea, to be a seer, a revelator, a translator, and a prophet, having all the gifts of God which he bestows upon the head of the church.627 - Doctrine and Covenants 107:98     Whereas other officers of the church, who belong not unto the Twelve, neither to the Seventy, are not under the responsibility to travel among all nations, but are to travel as their circumstances shall allow, notwithstanding they may hold as high and responsible offices in the church.628 - Doctrine and Covenants 109:55     Remember the kings, the princes, the nobles, and the great ones of the earth, and all people, and the churches, all the poor, the needy, and afflicted ones of the earth;629 - Doctrine and Covenants 109:71     Remember, O Lord, the presidents, even all the presidents of thy church, that thy right hand may exalt them, with all their families, and their immediate connections, that their names may be perpetuated and had in everlasting remembrance from generation to generation.630 - Doctrine and Covenants 109:72     Remember all thy church, O Lord, with all their families, and all their immediate connections, with all their sick and afflicted ones, with all the poor and meek of the earth; that the kingdom, which thou hast set up without hands, may become a great mountain and fill the whole earth;631 - Doctrine and Covenants 109:73     That thy church may come forth out of the wilderness of darkness, and shine forth fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners;632 - Doctrine and Covenants 109:79     And also this church, to put upon it thy name. And help us by the power of thy Spirit, that we may mingle our voices with those bright, shining seraphs around thy throne, with acclamations of praise, singing Hosanna to God and the Lamb!633 - Doctrine and Covenants 112:18     For on them have I laid the burden of all the churches for a little season.634 - Doctrine and Covenants 112:27     Therefore, see to it that ye trouble not yourselves concerning the affairs of my church in this place, saith the Lord.635 - Doctrine and Covenants 115:3     And also unto my faithful servants who are of the high council of my church in Zion, for thus it shall be called, and unto all the elders and people of my Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, scattered abroad in all the world;636 - Doctrine and Covenants 115:4     For thus shall my church be called in the last days, even The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.637 - Doctrine and Covenants 117:13     Therefore, let him contend earnestly for the redemption of the First Presidency of my Church, saith the Lord; and when he falls he shall rise again, for his sacrifice shall be more sacred unto me than his increase, saith the Lord.638 - Doctrine and Covenants 119:1     Verily, thus saith the Lord, I require all their surplus property to be put into the hands of the bishop of my church in Zion,639 - Doctrine and Covenants 119:2     For the building of mine house, and for the laying of the foundation of Zion and for the priesthood, and for the debts of the Presidency of my Church.640 - Doctrine and Covenants 120:1     Verily, thus saith the Lord, the time is now come, that it shall be disposed of by a council, composed of the First Presidency of my Church, and of the bishop and his council, and by my high council; and by mine own voice unto them, saith the Lord. Even so. Amen.641 - Doctrine and Covenants 124:32     But behold, at the end of this appointment your baptisms for your dead shall not be acceptable unto me; and if you do not these things at the end of the appointment ye shall be rejected as a church, with your dead, saith the Lord your God.642 - Doctrine and Covenants 124:41     For I deign to reveal unto my church things which have been kept hid from before the foundation of the world, things that pertain to the dispensation of the fulness of times.643 - Doctrine and Covenants 124:84     And with my servant Almon Babbitt, there are many things with which I am not pleased; behold, he aspireth to establish his counsel instead of the counsel which I have ordained, even that of the Presidency of my Church; and he setteth up a golden calf for the worship of my people.644 - Doctrine and Covenants 124:94     And from this time forth I appoint unto him that he may be a prophet, and a seer, and a revelator unto my church, as well as my servant Joseph;645 - Doctrine and Covenants 124:124     First, I give unto you Hyrum Smith to be a patriarch unto you, to hold the sealing blessings of my church, even the Holy Spirit of promise, whereby ye are sealed up unto the day of redemption, that ye may not fall notwithstanding the hour of temptation that may come upon you.646 - Doctrine and Covenants 124:125     I give unto you my servant Joseph to be a presiding elder over all my church, to be a translator, a revelator, a seer, and prophet.647 - Doctrine and Covenants 124:126     I give unto him for counselors my servant Sidney Rigdon and my servant William Law, that these may constitute a quorum and First Presidency, to receive the oracles for the whole church.648 - Doctrine and Covenants 124:136     I give unto him Amasa Lyman and Noah Packard for counselors, that they may preside over the quorum of high priests of my church, saith the Lord.649 - Doctrine and Covenants 124:137     And again, I say unto you, I give unto you John A. Hicks, Samuel Williams, and Jesse Baker, which priesthood is to preside over the quorum of elders, which quorum is instituted for standing ministers; nevertheless they may travel, yet they are ordained to be standing ministers to my church, saith the Lord.650 - Doctrine and Covenants 124:140     The difference between this quorum and the quorum of elders is that one is to travel continually, and the other is to preside over the churches from time to time; the one has the responsibility of presiding from time to time, and the other has no responsibility of presiding, saith the Lord your God.651 - Doctrine and Covenants 127:12     Behold, my prayer to God is that you all may be saved. And I subscribe myself your servant in the Lord, prophet and seer of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.652 - Doctrine and Covenants 128:4     Then, let there be a general recorder, to whom these other records can be handed, being attended with certificates over their own signatures, certifying that the record they have made is true. Then the general church recorder can enter the record on the general church book, with the certificates and all the attending witnesses, with his own statement that he verily believes the above statement and records to be true, from his knowledge of the general character and appointment of those men by the church. And when this is done on the general church book, the record shall be just as holy, and shall answer the ordinance just the same as if he had seen with his eyes and heard with his ears, and made a record of the same on the general church book.653 - Doctrine and Covenants 128:10     And again, for the precedent, Matthew 16:18, 19: And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.654 - Doctrine and Covenants 128:21     And again, the voice of God in the chamber of old Father Whitmer, in Fayette, Seneca county, and at sundry times, and in divers places through all the travels and tribulations of this Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints! And the voice of Michael, the archangel; the voice of Gabriel, and of Raphael, and of divers angels, from Michael or Adam down to the present time, all declaring their dispensation, their rights, their keys, their honors, their majesty and glory, and the power of their priesthood; giving line upon line, precept upon precept; here a little, and there a little; giving us consolation by holding forth that which is to come, confirming our hope!655 - Doctrine and Covenants 128:24     Behold, the great day of the Lord is at hand; and who can abide the day of his coming, and who can stand when he appeareth? For he is like a refiner's fire, and like fuller's soap; and he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness. Let us, therefore, as a church and a people, and as Latter-day Saints, offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness; and let us present in his holy temple, when it is finished, a book containing the records of our dead, which shall be worthy of all acceptation.656 - Doctrine and Covenants 133:1     Hearken, O ye people of my church, saith the Lord your God, and hear the word of the Lord concerning you--657 - Doctrine and Covenants 133:4     Wherefore, prepare ye, prepare ye, O my people; sanctify yourselves; gather ye together, O ye people of my church, upon the land of Zion, all you that have not been commanded to tarry.658 - Doctrine and Covenants 133:8     Send forth the elders of my church unto the nations which are afar off; unto the islands of the sea; send forth unto foreign lands; call upon all nations, first upon the Gentiles, and then upon the Jews.659 - Doctrine and Covenants 133:16     Hearken and hear, O ye inhabitants of the earth. Listen, ye elders of my church together, and hear the voice of the Lord; for he calleth upon all men, and he commandeth all men everywhere to repent.660 - Doctrine and Covenants 135:6     Hyrum Smith was forty-four years old in February, 1844, and Joseph Smith was thirty-eight in December, 1843; and henceforward their names will be classed among the martyrs of religion; and the reader in every nation will be reminded that the Book of Mormon, and this book of Doctrine and Covenants of the church, cost the best blood of the nineteenth century to bring them forth for the salvation of a ruined world; and that if the fire can scathe a green tree for the glory of God, how easy it will burn up the dry trees to purify the vineyard of corruption. They lived for glory; they died for glory; and glory is their eternal reward. From age to age shall their names go down to posterity as gems for the sanctified.661 - Doctrine and Covenants 136:2     Let all the people of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and those who journey with them, be organized into companies, with a covenant and promise to keep all the commandments and statutes of the Lord our God.662 - Doctrine and Covenants 136:41     Now, therefore, hearken, O ye people of my church; and ye elders listen together; you have received my kingdom.663 - Doctrine and Covenants 138:55     I observed that they were also among the noble and great ones who were chosen in the beginning to be rulers in the Church of God.664 - Joseph Smith--History 1:1     Owing to the many reports which have been put in circulation by evil-disposed and designing persons, in relation to the rise and progress of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, all of which have been designed by the authors thereof to militate against its character as a Church and its progress in the world--I have been induced to write this history, to disabuse the public mind, and put all inquirers after truth in possession of the facts, as they have transpired, in relation both to myself and the Church, so far as I have such facts in my possession.665 - Joseph Smith--History 1:2     In this history I shall present the various events in relation to this Church, in truth and righteousness, as they have transpired, or as they at present exist, being now [1838] the eighth year since the organization of the said Church.666 - Joseph Smith--History 1:7     I was at this time in my fifteenth year. My father's family was proselyted to the Presbyterian faith, and four of them joined that church, namely, my mother, Lucy; my brothers Hyrum and Samuel Harrison; and my sister Sophronia.667 - Joseph Smith--History 1:72     The messenger who visited us on this occasion and conferred this Priesthood upon us, said that his name was John, the same that is called John the Baptist in the New Testament, and that he acted under the direction of Peter, James and John, who held the keys of the Priesthood of Melchizedek, which Priesthood, he said, would in due time be conferred on us, and that I should be called the first Elder of the Church, and he (Oliver Cowdery) the second. It was on the fifteenth day of May, 1829, that we were ordained under the hand of this messenger, and baptized.668 - Joseph Smith--History 1:73     Immediately on our coming up out of the water after we had been baptized, we experienced great and glorious blessings from our Heavenly Father. No sooner had I baptized Oliver Cowdery, than the Holy Ghost fell upon him, and he stood up and prophesied many things which should shortly come to pass. And again, so soon as I had been baptized by him, I also had the spirit of prophecy, when, standing up, I prophesied concerning the rise of this Church, and many other things connected with the Church, and this generation of the children of men. We were filled with the Holy Ghost, and rejoiced in the God of our salvation.669 - Articles of Faith 1:6     We believe in the same organization that existed in the Primitive Church, namely, apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists, and so forth.
