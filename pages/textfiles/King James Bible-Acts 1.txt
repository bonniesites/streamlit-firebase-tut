Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into the man's house:86 - Acts 11:13     And he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter;87 - Acts 11:14     Who shall tell thee words, whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved.88 - Acts 11:15     And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning.89 - Acts 11:16     Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost.90 - Acts 11:17     Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that I could withstand God?91 - Acts 11:18     When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life.92 - Acts 11:19     Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only.93 - Acts 11:20     And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching the Lord Jesus.94 - Acts 11:21     And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord.95 - Acts 11:22     Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch.96 - Acts 11:23     Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord.97 - Acts 11:24     For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith: and much people was added unto the Lord.98 - Acts 11:25     Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul:99 - Acts 11:26     And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.100 - Acts 11:27     And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch.101 - Acts 11:28     And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.102 - Acts 11:29     Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judaea:103 - Acts 11:30     Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.104 - Acts 12:1     Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church.105 - Acts 12:2     And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.106 - Acts 12:3     And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.)107 - Acts 12:4     And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people.108 - Acts 12:5     Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him.109 - Acts 12:6     And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison.110 - Acts 12:7     And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands.111 - Acts 12:8     And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me.112 - Acts 12:9     And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision.113 - Acts 12:10     When they were past the first and the second ward, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to them of his own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and forthwith the angel departed from him.114 - Acts 12:11     And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.115 - Acts 12:12     And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying.116 - Acts 12:13     And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to hearken, named Rhoda.117 - Acts 12:14     And when she knew Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for gladness, but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the gate.118 - Acts 12:15     And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she constantly affirmed that it was even so. Then said they, It is his angel.119 - Acts 12:16     But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened the door, and saw him, they were astonished.120 - Acts 12:17     But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Go shew these things unto James, and to the brethren. And he departed, and went into another place.121 - Acts 12:18     Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what was become of Peter.122 - Acts 12:19     And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined the keepers, and commanded that they should be put to death. And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea, and there abode.123 - Acts 12:20     And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king's chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because their country was nourished by the king's country.124 - Acts 12:21     And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his throne, and made an oration unto them.125 - Acts 12:22     And the people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of a god, and not of a man.126 - Acts 12:23     And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost.127 - Acts 12:24     But the word of God grew and multiplied.128 - Acts 12:25     And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their ministry, and took with them John, whose surname was Mark.129 - Acts 13:1     Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.130 - Acts 13:2     As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.131 - Acts 13:3     And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.132 - Acts 13:4     So they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed unto Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.133 - Acts 13:5     And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John to their minister.134 - Acts 13:6     And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Bar-jesus:135 - Acts 13:7     Which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God.136 - Acts 13:8     But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith.137 - Acts 13:9     Then Saul, (who also is called Paul,) filled with the Holy Ghost, set his eyes on him,138 - Acts 13:10     And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, thou child of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?139 - Acts 13:11     And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.140 - Acts 13:12     Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.141 - Acts 13:13     Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem.142 - Acts 13:14     But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down.143 - Acts 13:15     And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Ye men and brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.144 - Acts 13:16     Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience.145 - Acts 13:17     The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with an high arm brought he them out of it.146 - Acts 13:18     And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the wilderness.147 - Acts 13:19     And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan, he divided their land to them by lot.148 - Acts 13:20     And after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.149 - Acts 13:21     And afterward they desired a king: and God gave unto them Saul the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of forty years.150 - Acts 13:22     And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be their king; to whom also he gave testimony, and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfil all my will.151 - Acts 13:23     Of this man's seed hath God according to his promise raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus:152 - Acts 13:24     When John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.153 - Acts 13:25     And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I am? I am not he. But, behold, there cometh one after me, whose shoes of his feet I am not worthy to loose.154 - Acts 13:26     Men and brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and whosoever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this salvation sent.155 - Acts 13:27     For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled them in condemning him.156 - Acts 13:28     And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they Pilate that he should be slain.157 - Acts 13:29     And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulchre.158 - Acts 13:30     But God raised him from the dead:159 - Acts 13:31     And he was seen many days of them which came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people.160 - Acts 13:32     And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made unto the fathers,161 - Acts 13:33     God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.162 - Acts 13:34     And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David.163 - Acts 13:35     Wherefore he saith also in another psalm, Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.164 - Acts 13:36     For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption:165 - Acts 13:37     But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption.166 - Acts 13:38     Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins:167 - Acts 13:39     And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.168 - Acts 13:40     Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the prophets;169 - Acts 13:41     Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe, though a man declare it unto you.170 - Acts 13:42     And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath.171 - Acts 13:43     Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.172 - Acts 13:44     And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God.173 - Acts 13:45     But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming.174 - Acts 13:46     Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.175 - Acts 13:47     For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth.176 - Acts 13:48     And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.177 - Acts 13:49     And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region.178 - Acts 13:50     But the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts.179 - Acts 13:51     But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came unto Iconium.180 - Acts 13:52     And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Ghost.181 - Acts 14:1     And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake, that a great multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed.182 - Acts 14:2     But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds evil affected against the brethren.183 - Acts 14:3     Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, which gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands.184 - Acts 14:4     But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles.185 - Acts 14:5     And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also of the Jews with their rulers, to use them despitefully, and to stone them,186 - Acts 14:6     They were ware of it, and fled unto Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and unto the region that lieth round about:187 - Acts 14:7     And there they preached the gospel.188 - Acts 14:8     And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet, being a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked:189 - Acts 14:9     The same heard Paul speak: who steadfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed,190 - Acts 14:10     Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped and walked.191 - Acts 14:11     And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.192 - Acts 14:12     And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because he was the chief speaker.193 - Acts 14:13     Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people.194 - Acts 14:14     Which when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out,195 - Acts 14:15     And saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein:196 - Acts 14:16     Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways.197 - Acts 14:17     Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.198 - Acts 14:18     And with these sayings scarce restrained they the people, that they had not done sacrifice unto them.199 - Acts 14:19     And there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who persuaded the people, and, having stoned Paul, drew him out of the city, supposing he had been dead.200 - Acts 14:20     Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and came into the city: and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.201 - Acts 14:21     And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch,202 - Acts 14:22     Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.203 - Acts 14:23     And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed.204 - Acts 14:24     And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.205 - Acts 14:25     And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down into Attalia:206 - Acts 14:26     And thence sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled.207 - Acts 14:27     And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles.208 - Acts 14:28     And there they abode long time with the disciples.209 - Acts 15:1     And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren, and said, Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved.210 - Acts 15:2     When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question.211 - Acts 15:3     And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren.212 - Acts 15:4     And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them.213 - Acts 15:5     But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.214 - Acts 15:6     And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter.215 - Acts 15:7     And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.216 - Acts 15:8     And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us;217 - Acts 15:9     And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.218 - Acts 15:10     Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?219 - Acts 15:11     But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they.220 - Acts 15:12     Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them.221 - Acts 15:13     And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men and brethren, hearken unto me:222 - Acts 15:14     Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.223 - Acts 15:15     And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,224 - Acts 15:16     After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up:225 - Acts 15:17     That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things.226 - Acts 15:18     Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world.227 - Acts 15:19     Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God:228 - Acts 15:20     But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood.229 - Acts 15:21     For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.230 - Acts 15:22     Then pleased it the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren:231 - Acts 15:23     And they wrote letters by them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia:232 - Acts 15:24     Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment:233 - Acts 15:25     It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,234 - Acts 15:26     Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.235 - Acts 15:27     We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you the same things by mouth.236 - Acts 15:28     For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things;237 - Acts 15:29     That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well.238 - Acts 15:30     So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle:239 - Acts 15:31     Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.240 - Acts 15:32     And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them.241 - Acts 15:33     And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles.242 - Acts 15:34     Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still.243 - Acts 15:35     Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.244 - Acts 15:36     And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, and see how they do.245 - Acts 15:37     And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark.246 - Acts 15:38     But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.247 - Acts 15:39     And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus;248 - Acts 15:40     And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of God.249 - Acts 15:41     And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.250 - Acts 16:1     Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a Greek:251 - Acts 16:2     Which was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium.252 - Acts 16:3     Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they knew all that his father was a Greek.253 - Acts 16:4     And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem.254 - Acts 16:5     And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily.255 - Acts 16:6     Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,256 - Acts 16:7     After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them not.257 - Acts 16:8     And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas.258 - Acts 16:9     And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us.259 - Acts 16:10     And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them.260 - Acts 16:11     Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis;261 - Acts 16:12     And from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony: and we were in that city abiding certain days.262 - Acts 16:13     And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the women which resorted thither.263 - Acts 16:14     And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul.264 - Acts 16:15     And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide there. And she constrained us.265 - Acts 16:16     And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:266 - Acts 16:17     The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation.267 - Acts 16:18     And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour.268 - Acts 16:19     And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers,269 - Acts 16:20     And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,270 - Acts 16:21     And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans.271 - Acts 16:22     And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat them.272 - Acts 16:23     And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:273 - Acts 16:24     Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.274 - Acts 16:25     And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them.275 - Acts 16:26     And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed.276 - Acts 16:27     And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled.277 - Acts 16:28     But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here.278 - Acts 16:29     Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas,279 - Acts 16:30     And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?280 - Acts 16:31     And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.281 - Acts 16:32     And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house.282 - Acts 16:33     And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway.283 - Acts 16:34     And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house.284 - Acts 16:35     And when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying, Let those men go.285 - Acts 16:36     And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in peace.286 - Acts 16:37     But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and fetch us out.287 - Acts 16:38     And the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates: and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans.288 - Acts 16:39     And they came and besought them, and brought them out, and desired them to depart out of the city.289 - Acts 16:40     And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.290 - Acts 17:1     Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:291 - Acts 17:2     And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,292 - Acts 17:3     Opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is Christ.293 - Acts 17:4     And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.294 - Acts 17:5     But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.295 - Acts 17:6     And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also;296 - Acts 17:7     Whom Jason hath received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus.297 - Acts 17:8     And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things.298 - Acts 17:9     And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other, they let them go.299 - Acts 17:10     And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea: who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews.300 - Acts 17:11     These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.301 - Acts 17:12     Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few.302 - Acts 17:13     But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred up the people.303 - Acts 17:14     And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still.304 - Acts 17:15     And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed, they departed.305 - Acts 17:16     Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.306 - Acts 17:17     Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him.307 - Acts 17:18     Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection.308 - Acts 17:19     And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is?309 - Acts 17:20     For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.310 - Acts 17:21     (For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)311 - Acts 17:22     Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said, Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious.312 - Acts 17:23     For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, To the Unknown God. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.313 - Acts 17:24     God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;314 - Acts 17:25     Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;315 - Acts 17:26     And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;316 - Acts 17:27     That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:317 - Acts 17:28     For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.318 - Acts 17:29     Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man's device.319 - Acts 17:30     And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent:320 - Acts 17:31     Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.321 - Acts 17:32     And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this matter.322 - Acts 17:33     So Paul departed from among them.323 - Acts 17:34     Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the which was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.324 - Acts 18:1     After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;325 - Acts 18:2     And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them.326 - Acts 18:3     And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.327 - Acts 18:4     And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.328 - Acts 18:5     And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ.329 - Acts 18:6     And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his raiment, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.330 - Acts 18:7     And he departed thence, and entered into a certain man's house, named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.331 - Acts 18:8     And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.332 - Acts 18:9     Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace:333 - Acts 18:10     For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city.334 - Acts 18:11     And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.335 - Acts 18:12     And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,336 - Acts 18:13     Saying, This fellow persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law.337 - Acts 18:14     And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:338 - Acts 18:15     But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look ye to it; for I will be no judge of such matters.339 - Acts 18:16     And he drave them from the judgment seat.340 - Acts 18:17     Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things.341 - Acts 18:18     And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.342 - Acts 18:19     And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.343 - Acts 18:20     When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he consented not;344 - Acts 18:21     But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus.345 - Acts 18:22     And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.346 - Acts 18:23     And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.347 - Acts 18:24     And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.348 - Acts 18:25     This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.349 - Acts 18:26     And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.350 - Acts 18:27     And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace:351 - Acts 18:28     For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ.352 - Acts 19:1     And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples,353 - Acts 19:2     He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost.354 - Acts 19:3     And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John's baptism.355 - Acts 19:4     Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.356 - Acts 19:5     When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.357 - Acts 19:6     And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.358 - Acts 19:7     And all the men were about twelve.359 - Acts 19:8     And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God.360 - Acts 19:9     But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.361 - Acts 19:10     And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.362 - Acts 19:11     And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul:363 - Acts 19:12     So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.364 - Acts 19:13     Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.365 - Acts 19:14     And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the priests, which did so.366 - Acts 19:15     And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye?367 - Acts 19:16     And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.368 - Acts 19:17     And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.369 - Acts 19:18     And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their deeds.370 - Acts 19:19     Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.371 - Acts 19:20     So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.372 - Acts 19:21     After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.373 - Acts 19:22     So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.374 - Acts 19:23     And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.375 - Acts 19:24     For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen;376 - Acts 19:25     Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth.377 - Acts 19:26     Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands:378 - Acts 19:27     So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.379 - Acts 19:28     And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.380 - Acts 19:29     And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre.381 - Acts 19:30     And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not.382 - Acts 19:31     And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent unto him, desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatre.383 - Acts 19:32     Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together.384 - Acts 19:33     And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defence unto the people.385 - Acts 19:34     But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.386 - Acts 19:35     And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?387 - Acts 19:36     Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.388 - Acts 19:37     For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess.389 - Acts 19:38     Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them implead one another.390 - Acts 19:39     But if ye inquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.391 - Acts 19:40     For we are in danger to be called in question for this day's uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse.392 - Acts 19:41     And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.
