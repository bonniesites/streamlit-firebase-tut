they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn way.419 - Judges 2:20     And the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel; and he said, Because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice;420 - Judges 2:22     That through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of the Lord to walk therein, as their fathers did keep it, or not.421 - Judges 3:4     And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the Lord, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.422 - Judges 4:11     Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab the father in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim, which is by Kedesh.423 - Judges 6:13     And Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the Lord be with us, why then is all this befallen us? and where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt? but now the Lord hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites.424 - Judges 6:15     And he said unto him, Oh my Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel? behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house.425 - Judges 6:25     And it came to pass the same night, that the Lord said unto him, Take thy father's young bullock, even the second bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and cut down the grove that is by it:426 - Judges 6:27     Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the Lord had said unto him: and so it was, because he feared his father's household, and the men of the city, that he could not do it by day, that he did it by night.427 - Judges 8:32     And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abi-ezrites.428 - Judges 9:1     And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mother's brethren, and communed with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother's father, saying,429 - Judges 9:5     And he went unto his father's house at Ophrah, and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, being threescore and ten persons, upon one stone: notwithstanding yet Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself.430 - Judges 9:17     (For my father fought for you, and adventured his life far, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian:431 - Judges 9:18     And ye are risen up against my father's house this day, and have slain his sons, threescore and ten persons, upon one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother;)432 - Judges 9:28     And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? is not he the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem: for why should we serve him?433 - Judges 9:56     Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren:434 - Judges 11:2     And Gilead's wife bare him sons; and his wife's sons grew up, and they thrust out Jephthah, and said unto him, Thou shalt not inherit in our father's house; for thou art the son of a strange woman.435 - Judges 11:7     And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate me, and expel me out of my father's house? and why are ye come unto me now when ye are in distress?436 - Judges 11:36     And she said unto him, My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth unto the Lord, do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the Lord hath taken vengeance for thee of thine enemies, even of the children of Ammon.437 - Judges 11:37     And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows.438 - Judges 11:39     And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed: and she knew no man. And it was a custom in Israel,439 - Judges 14:2     And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife.440 - Judges 14:3     Then his father and his mother said unto him, Is there never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said unto his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well.441 - Judges 14:4     But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the Lord, that he sought an occasion against the Philistines: for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel.442 - Judges 14:5     Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath, and came to the vineyards of Timnath: and, behold, a young lion roared against him.443 - Judges 14:6     And the Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done.444 - Judges 14:9     And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came to his father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat: but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion.445 - Judges 14:10     So his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do.446 - Judges 14:15     And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson's wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with fire: have ye called us to take that we have? is it not so?447 - Judges 14:16     And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people, and hast not told it me. And he said unto her, Behold, I have not told it my father nor my mother, and shall I tell it thee?448 - Judges 14:19     And the Spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father's house.449 - Judges 15:1     But it came to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not suffer him to go in.450 - Judges 15:2     And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: is not her younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her.451 - Judges 15:6     Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they answered, Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he had taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.452 - Judges 16:31     Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the buryingplace of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years.453 - Judges 17:10     And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten shekels of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in.454 - Judges 18:19     And they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thine hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: is it better for thee to be a priest unto the house of one man, or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family in Israel?455 - Judges 18:29     And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born unto Israel: howbeit the name of the city was Laish at the first.456 - Judges 19:2     And his concubine played the whore against him, and went away from him unto her father's house to Beth-lehem-judah, and was there four whole months.457 - Judges 19:3     And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak friendly unto her, and to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple of asses: and she brought him into her father's house: and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.458 - Judges 19:4     And his father in law, the damsel's father, retained him; and he abode with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and lodged there.459 - Judges 19:5     And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early in the morning, that he rose up to depart: and the damsel's father said unto his son in law, Comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward go your way.460 - Judges 19:6     And they sat down, and did eat and drink both of them together: for the damsel's father had said unto the man, Be content, I pray thee, and tarry all night, and let thine heart be merry.461 - Judges 19:7     And when the man rose up to depart, his father in law urged him: therefore he lodged there again.462 - Judges 19:8     And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart: and the damsel's father said, Comfort thine heart, I pray thee. And they tarried until afternoon, and they did eat both of them.463 - Judges 19:9     And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father in law, the damsel's father, said unto him, Behold, now the day draweth toward evening, I pray you tarry all night: behold, the day groweth to an end, lodge here, that thine heart may be merry; and to morrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go home.464 - Judges 21:22     And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come unto us to complain, that we will say unto them, Be favourable unto them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war: for ye did not give unto them at this time, that ye should be guilty.465 - Ruth 2:11     And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been shewed me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of thine husband: and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people which thou knewest not heretofore.466 - Ruth 4:17     And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the father of David.467 - 1 Samuel 2:25     If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the Lord, who shall entreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the Lord would slay them.468 - 1 Samuel 2:27     And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the Lord, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?469 - 1 Samuel 2:28     And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?470 - 1 Samuel 2:30     Wherefore the Lord God of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the Lord saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.471 - 1 Samuel 2:31     Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thine house.472 - 1 Samuel 4:19     And his daughter in law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father in law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came upon her.473 - 1 Samuel 4:21     And she named the child I-chabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father in law and her husband.474 - 1 Samuel 9:3     And the asses of Kish Saul's father were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses.475 - 1 Samuel 9:5     And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave caring for the asses, and take thought for us.476 - 1 Samuel 9:20     And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And on whom is all the desire of Israel? Is it not on thee, and on all thy father's house?477 - 1 Samuel 10:2     When thou art departed from me to day, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel's sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found: and, lo, thy father hath left the care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?478 - 1 Samuel 10:12     And one of the same place answered and said, But who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?479 - 1 Samuel 12:6     And Samuel said unto the people, It is the Lord that advanced Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.480 - 1 Samuel 12:7     Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the Lord of all the righteous acts of the Lord, which he did to you and to your fathers.481 - 1 Samuel 12:8     When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto the Lord, then the Lord sent Moses and Aaron, which brought forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this place.482 - 1 Samuel 12:15     But if ye will not obey the voice of the Lord, but rebel against the commandment of the Lord, then shall the hand of the Lord be against you, as it was against your fathers.483 - 1 Samuel 14:1     Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines' garrison, that is on the other side. But he told not his father.484 - 1 Samuel 14:27     But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.485 - 1 Samuel 14:28     Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food this day. And the people were faint.486 - 1 Samuel 14:29     Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.487 - 1 Samuel 14:51     And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.488 - 1 Samuel 17:15     But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Beth-lehem.489 - 1 Samuel 17:25     And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel.490 - 1 Samuel 17:34     And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father's sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:491 - 1 Samuel 18:2     And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father's house.492 - 1 Samuel 18:18     And David said unto Saul, Who am I? and what is my life, or my father's family in Israel, that I should be son in law to the king?493 - 1 Samuel 19:2     But Jonathan Saul's son delighted much in David: and Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to kill thee: now therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself until the morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide thyself:494 - 1 Samuel 19:3     And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art, and I will commune with my father of thee; and what I see, that I will tell thee.495 - 1 Samuel 19:4     And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and said unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; because he hath not sinned against thee, and because his works have been to thee-ward very good:496 - 1 Samuel 20:1     And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? what is mine iniquity? and what is my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life?497 - 1 Samuel 20:2     And he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold, my father will do nothing either great or small, but that he will shew it me: and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not so.498 - 1 Samuel 20:3     And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly as the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is but a step between me and death.499 - 1 Samuel 20:6     If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Beth-lehem his city: for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.500 - 1 Samuel 20:8     Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the Lord with thee: notwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?501 - 1 Samuel 20:9     And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee: for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee?502 - 1 Samuel 20:10     Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what if thy father answer thee roughly?503 - 1 Samuel 20:12     And Jonathan said unto David, O Lord God of Israel, when I have sounded my father about to morrow any time, or the third day, and, behold, if there be good toward David, and I then send not unto thee, and shew it thee;504 - 1 Samuel 20:13     The Lord do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my father to do thee evil, then I will shew it thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and the Lord be with thee, as he hath been with my father.505 - 1 Samuel 20:32     And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore shall he be slain? what hath he done?506 - 1 Samuel 20:33     And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay David.507 - 1 Samuel 20:34     So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.508 - 1 Samuel 22:1     David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave Adullam: and when his brethren and all his father's house heard it, they went down thither to him.509 - 1 Samuel 22:3     And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth, and be with you, till I know what God will do for me.510 - 1 Samuel 22:11     Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests that were in Nob: and they came all of them to the king.511 - 1 Samuel 22:15     Did I then begin to inquire of God for him? be it far from me: let not the king impute any thing unto his servant, nor to all the house of my father: for thy servant knew nothing of all this, less or more.512 - 1 Samuel 22:16     And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father's house.513 - 1 Samuel 22:22     And David said unto Abiathar, I knew it that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have occasioned the death of all the persons of thy father's house.514 - 1 Samuel 23:17     And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.515 - 1 Samuel 24:11     Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in mine hand, and I have not sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my soul to take it.516 - 1 Samuel 24:21     Swear now therefore unto me by the Lord, that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father's house.517 - 2 Samuel 2:32     And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which was in Beth-lehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at break of day.518 - 2 Samuel 3:7     And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and Ish-bosheth said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father's concubine?519 - 2 Samuel 3:8     Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ish-bosheth, and said, Am I a dog's head, which against Judah do shew kindness this day unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David, that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning this woman?520 - 2 Samuel 3:29     Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father's house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth on the sword, or that lacketh bread.521 - 2 Samuel 6:21     And David said unto Michal, It was before the Lord, which chose me before thy father, and before all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the Lord, over Israel: therefore will I play before the Lord.522 - 2 Samuel 7:12     And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.523 - 2 Samuel 7:14     I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men:524 - 2 Samuel 9:7     And David said unto him, Fear not: for I will surely shew thee kindness for Jonathan thy father's sake, and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually.525 - 2 Samuel 10:2     Then said David, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father shewed kindness unto me. And David sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.526 - 2 Samuel 10:3     And the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their lord, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? hath not David rather sent his servants unto thee, to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?527 - 2 Samuel 13:5     And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her hand.528 - 2 Samuel 14:9     And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father's house: and the king and his throne be guiltless.529 - 2 Samuel 15:34     But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father's servant hitherto, so will I now also be thy servant: then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.530 - 2 Samuel 16:3     And the king said, And where is thy master's son? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he said, To day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.531 - 2 Samuel 16:19     And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father's presence, so will I be in thy presence.532 - 2 Samuel 16:21     And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father's concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then shall the hands of all that are with thee be strong.533 - 2 Samuel 16:22     So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.534 - 2 Samuel 17:8     For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they be mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and thy father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.535 - 2 Samuel 17:10     And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, shall utterly melt: for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man, and they which be with him are valiant men.536 - 2 Samuel 17:23     And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose, and gat him home to his house, to his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father.537 - 2 Samuel 19:28     For all of my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the king?538 - 2 Samuel 19:37     Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, and be buried by the grave of my father and of my mother. But behold thy servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good unto thee.539 - 2 Samuel 21:14     And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulchre of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded. And after that God was entreated for the land.540 - 2 Samuel 24:17     And David spake unto the Lord when he saw the angel that smote the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father's house.541 - 1 Kings 1:6     And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so? and he also was a very goodly man; and his mother bare him after Absalom.542 - 1 Kings 1:21     Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.543 - 1 Kings 2:10     So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.544 - 1 Kings 2:12     Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly.545 - 1 Kings 2:24     Now therefore, as the Lord liveth, which hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me an house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day.546 - 1 Kings 2:26     And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the Lord God before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.547 - 1 Kings 2:31     And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father.548 - 1 Kings 2:32     And the Lord shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing thereof, to wit, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.549 - 1 Kings 2:44     The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father: therefore the Lord shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head;550 - 1 Kings 3:3     And Solomon loved the Lord, walking in the statutes of David his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places.551 - 1 Kings 3:6     And Solomon said, Thou hast shewed unto thy servant David my father great mercy, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day.552 - 1 Kings 3:7     And now, O Lord my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father: and I am but a little child: I know not how to go out or come in.553 - 1 Kings 3:14     And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen thy days.554 - 1 Kings 5:1     And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David.555 - 1 Kings 5:3     Thou knowest how that David my father could not build an house unto the name of the Lord his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until the Lord put them under the soles of his feet.556 - 1 Kings 5:5     And, behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name of the Lord my God, as the Lord spake unto David my father, saying, Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build an house unto my name.557 - 1 Kings 6:12     Concerning this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my word with thee, which I spake unto David thy father:558 - 1 Kings 7:14     He was a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and cunning to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work.559 - 1 Kings 7:51     So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the Lord. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated; even the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, did he put among the treasures of the house of the Lord.560 - 1 Kings 8:1     Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the city of David, which is Zion.561 - 1 Kings 8:15     And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, which spake with his mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hand fulfilled it, saying,562 - 1 Kings 8:17     And it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the Lord God of Israel.563 - 1 Kings 8:18     And the Lord said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thine heart to build an house unto my name, thou didst well that it was in thine heart.564 - 1 Kings 8:20     And the Lord hath performed his word that he spake, and I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the Lord promised, and have built an house for the name of the Lord God of Israel.565 - 1 Kings 8:21     And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant of the Lord, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.566 - 1 Kings 8:24     Who hast kept with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst him: thou spakest also with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thine hand, as it is this day.567 - 1 Kings 8:25     Therefore now, Lord God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel; so that thy children take heed to their way, that they walk before me as thou hast walked before me.568 - 1 Kings 8:26     And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father.569 - 1 Kings 8:34     Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto their fathers.570 - 1 Kings 8:40     That they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers.571 - 1 Kings 8:48     And so return unto thee with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their enemies, which led them away captive, and pray unto thee toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, the city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name:572 - 1 Kings 8:53     For thou didst separate them from among all the people of the earth, to be thine inheritance, as thou spakest by the hand of Moses thy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord God.573 - 1 Kings 8:57     The Lord our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him not leave us, nor forsake us:574 - 1 Kings 8:58     That he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, which he commanded our fathers.575 - 1 Kings 9:4     And if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and my judgments:576 - 1 Kings 9:5     Then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever, as I promised to David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel.577 - 1 Kings 9:9     And they shall answer, Because they forsook the Lord their God, who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and have taken hold upon other gods, and have worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath the Lord brought upon them all this evil.578 - 1 Kings 11:4     For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God, as was the heart of David his father.579 - 1 Kings 11:6     And Solomon did evil in the sight of the Lord, and went not fully after the Lord, as did David his father.580 - 1 Kings 11:12     Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thy father's sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.581 - 1 Kings 11:17     That Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad being yet a little child.582 - 1 Kings 11:21     And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to mine own country.583 - 1 Kings 11:27     And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breaches of the city of David his father.584 - 1 Kings 11:33     Because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in mine eyes, and to keep my statutes and my judgments, as did David his father.585 - 1 Kings 11:43     And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.586 - 1 Kings 12:4     Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.587 - 1 Kings 12:6     And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise that I may answer this people?588 - 1 Kings 12:9     And he said unto them, What counsel give ye that we may answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter?589 - 1 Kings 12:10     And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins.590 - 1 Kings 12:11     And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.591 - 1 Kings 12:14     And spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke: my father also chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.592 - 1 Kings 13:11     Now there dwelt an old prophet in Beth-el; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Beth-el: the words which he had spoken unto the king, them they told also to their father.593 - 1 Kings 13:12     And their father said unto them, What way went he? For his sons had seen what way the man of God went, which came from Judah.594 - 1 Kings 13:22     But camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place, of the which the Lord did say to thee, Eat no bread, and drink no water; thy carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers.595 - 1 Kings 14:15     For the Lord shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water, and he shall root up Israel out of this good land, which he gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the river, because they have made their groves, provoking the Lord to anger.596 - 1 Kings 14:20     And the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years: and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his stead.597 - 1 Kings 14:22     And Judah did evil in the sight of the Lord, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed, above all that their fathers had done.598 - 1 Kings 14:31     And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess. And Abijam his son reigned in his stead.599 - 1 Kings 15:3     And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him: and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God, as the heart of David his father.600 - 1 Kings 15:8     And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead.601 - 1 Kings 15:11     And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, as did David his father.602 - 1 Kings 15:12     And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made.603 - 1 Kings 15:15     And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated, and the things which himself had dedicated, into the house of the Lord, silver, and gold, and vessels.604 - 1 Kings 15:19     There is a league between me and thee, and between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold; come and break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.605 - 1 Kings 15:24     And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead.606 - 1 Kings 15:26     And he did evil in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.607 - 1 Kings 16:6     So Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah: and Elah his son reigned in his stead.608 - 1 Kings 16:28     So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria: and Ahab his son reigned in his stead.609 - 1 Kings 18:18     And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the Lord, and thou hast followed Baalim.610 - 1 Kings 19:4     But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O Lord, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.611 - 1 Kings 19:20     And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow thee. And he said unto him, Go back again: for what have I done to thee?612 - 1 Kings 20:34     And Ben-hadad said unto him, The cities, which my father took from thy father, I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thee in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. Then said Ahab, I will send thee away with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and sent him away.613 - 1 Kings 21:3     And Naboth said to Ahab, The Lord forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee.614 - 1 Kings 21:4     And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.615 - 1 Kings 22:40     So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.616 - 1 Kings 22:43     And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the Lord: nevertheless the high places were not taken away; for the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places.617 - 1 Kings 22:46     And the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days of his father Asa, he took out of the land.618 - 1 Kings 22:50     And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.619 - 1 Kings 22:52     And he did evil in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin:620 - 1 Kings 22:53     For he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger the Lord God of Israel, according to all that his father had done.621 - 2 Kings 2:12     And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.622 - 2 Kings 3:2     And he wrought evil in the sight of the Lord; but not like his father, and like his mother: for he put away the image of Baal that his father had made.623 - 2 Kings 3:13     And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee? get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said unto him, Nay: for the Lord hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab.624 - 2 Kings 4:18     And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.625 - 2 Kings 4:19     And he said unto his father, My head, my head. And he said to a lad, Carry him to his mother.626 - 2 Kings 5:13     And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?627 - 2 Kings 6:21     And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, My father, shall I smite them? shall I smite them?628 - 2 Kings 8:24     And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.629 - 2 Kings 9:25     Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember how that, when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father, the Lord laid this burden upon him;630 - 2 Kings 9:28     And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of David.631 - 2 Kings 10:3     Look even out the best and meetest of your master's sons, and set him on his father's throne, and fight for your master's house.632 - 2 Kings 10:35     And Jehu slept with his fathers: and they buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead.633 - 2 Kings 12:18     And Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that Jehoshaphat, and Jehoram, and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own hallowed things, and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of the Lord, and in the king's house, and sent it to Hazael king of Syria: and he went away from Jerusalem.634 - 2 Kings 12:21     For Jozachar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, smote him, and he died; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.635 - 2 Kings 13:9     And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria: and Joash his son reigned in his stead.636 - 2 Kings 13:13     And Joash slept with his fathers; and Jeroboam sat upon his throne: and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.637 - 2 Kings 13:14     Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died. And Joash the king of Israel came down unto him, and wept over his face, and said, O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof.638 - 2 Kings 13:25     And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael the cities, which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Three times did Joash beat him, and recovered the cities of Israel.639 - 2 Kings 14:3     And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, yet not like David his father: he did according to all things as Joash his father did.640 - 2 Kings 14:5     And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in his hand, that he slew his servants which had slain the king his father.641 - 2 Kings 14:6     But the children of the murderers he slew not: according unto that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, wherein the Lord commanded, saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the children be put to death for the fathers; but every man shall be put to death for his own sin.642 - 2 Kings 14:16     And Jehoash slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his stead.643 - 2 Kings 14:20     And they brought him on horses: and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David.644 - 2 Kings 14:21     And all the people of Judah took Azariah, which was sixteen years old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah.645 - 2 Kings 14:22     He built Elath, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers.646 - 2 Kings 14:29     And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, even with the kings of Israel; and Zachariah his son reigned in his stead.647 - 2 Kings 15:3     And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his father Amaziah had done;648 - 2 Kings 15:7     So Azariah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.649 - 2 Kings 15:9     And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, as his fathers had done: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.650 - 2 Kings 15:22     And Menahem slept with his fathers; and Pekahiah his son reigned in his stead.651 - 2 Kings 15:34     And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord: he did according to all that his father Uzziah had done.652 - 2 Kings 15:38     And Jotham slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.653 - 2 Kings 16:2     Twenty years old was Ahaz when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem, and did not that which was right in the sight of the Lord his God, like David his father.654 - 2 Kings 16:20     And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.655 - 2 Kings 17:13     Yet the Lord testified against Israel, and against Judah, by all the prophets, and by all the seers, saying, Turn ye from your evil ways, and keep my commandments and my statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets.656 - 2 Kings 17:14     Notwithstanding they would not hear, but hardened their necks, like to the neck of their fathers, that did not believe in the Lord their God.657 - 2 Kings 17:15     And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified against them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and went after the heathen that were round about them, concerning whom the Lord had charged them, that they should not do like them.658 - 2 Kings 17:41     So these nations feared the Lord, and served their graven images, both their children, and their children's children: as did their fathers, so do they unto this day.659 - 2 Kings 18:3     And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, according to all that David his father did.660 - 2 Kings 19:12     Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed; as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which were in Thelasar?661 - 2 Kings 20:5     Turn again, and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus saith the Lord, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee: on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the Lord.662 - 2 Kings 20:17     Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day, shall be carried into Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the Lord.663 - 2 Kings 20:21     And Hezekiah slept with his fathers: and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.664 - 2 Kings 21:3     For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made a grove, as did Ahab king of Israel; and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.665 - 2 Kings 21:8     Neither will I make the feet of Israel move any more out of the land which I gave their fathers; only if they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them.666 - 2 Kings 21:15     Because they have done that which was evil in my sight, and have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt, even unto this day.667 - 2 Kings 21:18     And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.668 - 2 Kings 21:20     And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, as his father Manasseh did.669 - 2 Kings 21:21     And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshipped them:670 - 2 Kings 21:22     And he forsook the Lord God of his fathers, and walked not in the way of the Lord.671 - 2 Kings 22:2     And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, and walked in all the way of David his father, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left.672 - 2 Kings 22:13     Go ye, inquire of the Lord for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found: for great is the wrath of the Lord that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this book, to do according unto all that which is written concerning us.673 - 2 Kings 22:20     Behold therefore, I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace;

also to grave any manner of graving, and to find out every device which shall be put to him, with thy cunning men, and with the cunning men of my lord David thy father.775 - 2 Chronicles 2:17     And Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of Israel, after the numbering wherewith David his father had numbered them; and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred.776 - 2 Chronicles 3:1     Then Solomon began to build the house of the Lord at Jerusalem in mount Moriah, where the Lord appeared unto David his father, in the place that David had prepared in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.777 - 2 Chronicles 4:16     The pots also, and the shovels, and the fleshhooks, and all their instruments, did Huram his father make to king Solomon for the house of the Lord of bright brass.778 - 2 Chronicles 5:1     Thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the Lord was finished: and Solomon brought in all the things that David his father had dedicated; and the silver, and the gold, and all the instruments, put he among the treasures of the house of God.779 - 2 Chronicles 5:2     Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the city of David, which is Zion.780 - 2 Chronicles 6:4     And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who hath with his hands fulfilled that which he spake with his mouth to my father David, saying,781 - 2 Chronicles 6:7     Now it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the Lord God of Israel.782 - 2 Chronicles 6:8     But the Lord said to David my father, Forasmuch as it was in thine heart to build an house for my name, thou didst well in that it was in thine heart:783 - 2 Chronicles 6:10     The Lord therefore hath performed his word that he hath spoken: for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and am set on the throne of Israel, as the Lord promised, and have built the house for the name of the Lord God of Israel.784 - 2 Chronicles 6:15     Thou which hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him; and spakest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thine hand, as it is this day.785 - 2 Chronicles 6:16     Now therefore, O Lord God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit upon the throne of Israel; yet so that thy children take heed to their way to walk in my law, as thou hast walked before me.786 - 2 Chronicles 6:25     Then hear thou from the heavens, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathers.787 - 2 Chronicles 6:31     That they may fear thee, to walk in thy ways, so long as they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers.788 - 2 Chronicles 6:38     If they return to thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, whither they have carried them captives, and pray toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, and toward the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house which I have built for thy name:789 - 2 Chronicles 7:17     And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded thee, and shalt observe my statutes and my judgments;790 - 2 Chronicles 7:18     Then will I stablish the throne of thy kingdom, according as I have covenanted with David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in Israel.791 - 2 Chronicles 7:22     And it shall be answered, Because they forsook the Lord God of their fathers, which brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath he brought all this evil upon them.792 - 2 Chronicles 8:14     And he appointed, according to the order of David his father, the courses of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their charges, to praise and minister before the priests, as the duty of every day required: the porters also by their courses at every gate: for so had David the man of God commanded.793 - 2 Chronicles 9:31     And Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.794 - 2 Chronicles 10:4     Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore ease thou somewhat the grievous servitude of thy father, and his heavy yoke that he put upon us, and we will serve thee.795 - 2 Chronicles 10:6     And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye me to return answer to this people?796 - 2 Chronicles 10:9     And he said unto them, What advice give ye that we may return answer to this people, which have spoken to me, saying, Ease somewhat the yoke that thy father did put upon us?797 - 2 Chronicles 10:10     And the young men that were brought up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou answer the people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it somewhat lighter for us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins.798 - 2 Chronicles 10:11     For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I will put more to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.799 - 2 Chronicles 10:14     And answered them after the advice of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.800 - 2 Chronicles 11:16     And after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set their hearts to seek the Lord God of Israel came to Jerusalem, to sacrifice unto the Lord God of their fathers.801 - 2 Chronicles 12:16     And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead.802 - 2 Chronicles 13:12     And, behold, God himself is with us for our captain, and his priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you. O children of Israel, fight ye not against the Lord God of your fathers; for ye shall not prosper.803 - 2 Chronicles 13:18     Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon the Lord God of their fathers.804 - 2 Chronicles 14:1     So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years.805 - 2 Chronicles 14:4     And commanded Judah to seek the Lord God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.806 - 2 Chronicles 15:12     And they entered into a covenant to seek the Lord God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul;807 - 2 Chronicles 15:18     And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.808 - 2 Chronicles 16:3     There is a league between me and thee, as there was between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent thee silver and gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.809 - 2 Chronicles 16:13     And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign.810 - 2 Chronicles 17:2     And he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken.811 - 2 Chronicles 17:3     And the Lord was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father David, and sought not unto Baalim;812 - 2 Chronicles 17:4     But sought to the Lord God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not after the doings of Israel.813 - 2 Chronicles 17:14     And these are the numbers of them according to the house of their fathers: Of Judah, the captains of thousands; Adnah the chief, and with him mighty men of valour three hundred thousand.814 - 2 Chronicles 19:4     And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again through the people from Beer-sheba to mount Ephraim, and brought them back unto the Lord God of their fathers.815 - 2 Chronicles 19:8     Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites, and of the priests, and of the chief of the fathers of Israel, for the judgment of the Lord, and for controversies, when they returned to Jerusalem.816 - 2 Chronicles 20:6     And said, O Lord God of our fathers, art not thou God in heaven? and rulest not thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen? and in thine hand is there not power and might, so that none is able to withstand thee?817 - 2 Chronicles 20:32     And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and departed not from it, doing that which was right in the sight of the Lord.818 - 2 Chronicles 20:33     Howbeit the high places were not taken away: for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their fathers.819 - 2 Chronicles 21:1     Now Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.820 - 2 Chronicles 21:3     And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fenced cities in Judah: but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram; because he was the firstborn.821 - 2 Chronicles 21:4     Now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself, and slew all his brethren with the sword, and divers also of the princes of Israel.822 - 2 Chronicles 21:10     So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. The same time also did Libnah revolt from under his hand; because he had forsaken the Lord God of his fathers.823 - 2 Chronicles 21:12     And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus saith the Lord God of David thy father, Because thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah,824 - 2 Chronicles 21:13     But hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a whoring, like to the whoredoms of the house of Ahab, and also hast slain thy brethren of thy father's house, which were better than thyself:825 - 2 Chronicles 21:19     And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of two years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness: so he died of sore diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers.826 - 2 Chronicles 22:4     Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the Lord like the house of Ahab: for they were his counsellors after the death of his father to his destruction.827 - 2 Chronicles 23:2     And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the chief of the fathers of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.828 - 2 Chronicles 24:18     And they left the house of the Lord God of their fathers, and served groves and idols: and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their trespass.829 - 2 Chronicles 24:22     Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he said, The Lord look upon it, and require it.830 - 2 Chronicles 24:24     For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men, and the Lord delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had forsaken the Lord God of their fathers. So they executed judgment against Joash.831 - 2 Chronicles 25:3     Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him, that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father.832 - 2 Chronicles 25:4     But he slew not their children, but did as it is written in the law in the book of Moses, where the Lord commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers, but every man shall die for his own sin.833 - 2 Chronicles 25:5     Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made them captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, according to the houses of their fathers, throughout all Judah and Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and above, and found them three hundred thousand choice men, able to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield.834 - 2 Chronicles 25:28     And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.835 - 2 Chronicles 26:1     Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah.836 - 2 Chronicles 26:2     He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers.837 - 2 Chronicles 26:4     And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his father Amaziah did.838 - 2 Chronicles 26:12     The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men of valour were two thousand and six hundred.839 - 2 Chronicles 26:23     So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings; for they said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.840 - 2 Chronicles 27:2     And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his father Uzziah did: howbeit he entered not into the temple of the Lord. And the people did yet corruptly.841 - 2 Chronicles 27:9     And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.842 - 2 Chronicles 28:1     Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: but he did not that which was right in the sight of the Lord, like David his father:843 - 2 Chronicles 28:6     For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah an hundred and twenty thousand in one day, which were all valiant men; because they had forsaken the Lord God of their fathers.844 - 2 Chronicles 28:9     But a prophet of the Lord was there, whose name was Oded: and he went out before the host that came to Samaria, and said unto them, Behold, because the Lord God of your fathers was wroth with Judah, he hath delivered them into your hand, and ye have slain them in a rage that reacheth up unto heaven.845 - 2 Chronicles 28:25     And in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger the Lord God of his fathers.846 - 2 Chronicles 28:27     And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, even in Jerusalem: but they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.847 - 2 Chronicles 29:2     And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, according to all that David his father had done.848 - 2 Chronicles 29:5     And said unto them, Hear me, ye Levites, sanctify now yourselves, and sanctify the house of the Lord God of your fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place.849 - 2 Chronicles 29:6     For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the Lord, and turned their backs.850 - 2 Chronicles 29:9     For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.851 - 2 Chronicles 30:7     And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which trespassed against the Lord God of their fathers, who therefore gave them up to desolation, as ye see.852 - 2 Chronicles 30:8     Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers were, but yield yourselves unto the Lord, and enter into his sanctuary, which he hath sanctified for ever: and serve the Lord your God, that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you.853 - 2 Chronicles 30:19     That prepareth his heart to seek God, the Lord God of his fathers, though he be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary.854 - 2 Chronicles 30:22     And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught the good knowledge of the Lord: and they did eat throughout the feast seven days, offering peace offerings, and making confession to the Lord God of their fathers.855 - 2 Chronicles 31:17     Both to the genealogy of the priests by the house of their fathers, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their charges by their courses;856 - 2 Chronicles 32:13     Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the people of other lands? were the gods of the nations of those lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand?857 - 2 Chronicles 32:14     Who was there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of mine hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of mine hand?858 - 2 Chronicles 32:15     Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you on this manner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of mine hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of mine hand?859 - 2 Chronicles 32:33     And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.860 - 2 Chronicles 33:3     For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down, and he reared up altars for Baalim, and made groves, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.861 - 2 Chronicles 33:8     Neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from out of the land which I have appointed for your fathers; so that they will take heed to do all that I have commanded them, according to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of Moses.862 - 2 Chronicles 33:12     And when he was in affliction, he besought the Lord his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers,863 - 2 Chronicles 33:20     So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.864 - 2 Chronicles 33:22     But he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, as did Manasseh his father: for Amon sacrificed unto all the carved images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them;865 - 2 Chronicles 33:23     And humbled not himself before the Lord, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but Amon trespassed more and more.866 - 2 Chronicles 34:2     And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the ways of David his father, and declined neither to the right hand, nor to the left.867 - 2 Chronicles 34:3     For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father: and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images.868 - 2 Chronicles 34:21     Go, inquire of the Lord for me, and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found: for great is the wrath of the Lord that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the Lord, to do after all that is written in this book.869 - 2 Chronicles 34:28     Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants of the same. So they brought the king word again.870 - 2 Chronicles 34:32     And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.871 - 2 Chronicles 34:33     And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made all that were present in Israel to serve, even to serve the Lord their God. And all his days they departed not from following the Lord, the God of their fathers.872 - 2 Chronicles 35:4     And prepare yourselves by the houses of your fathers, after your courses, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son.873 - 2 Chronicles 35:5     And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brethren the people, and after the division of the families of the Levites.874 - 2 Chronicles 35:24     His servants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died, and was buried in one of the sepulchres of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.875 - 2 Chronicles 36:1     Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his father's stead in Jerusalem.876 - 2 Chronicles 36:15     And the Lord God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers, rising up betimes, and sending; because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling place:877 - Ezra 1:5     Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, with all them whose spirit God had raised, to go up to build the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem.878 - Ezra 2:59     And these were they which went up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsa, Cherub, Addan, and Immer: but they could not shew their father's house, and their seed, whether they were of Israel:879 - Ezra 2:68     And some of the chief of the fathers, when they came to the house of the Lord which is at Jerusalem, offered freely for the house of God to set it up in his place:880 - Ezra 3:12     But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers, who were ancient men, that had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy:881 - Ezra 4:2     Then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers, and said unto them, Let us build with you: for we seek your God, as ye do; and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of Esar-haddon king of Assur, which brought us up hither.882 - Ezra 4:3     But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us to build an house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto the Lord God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us.883 - Ezra 4:15     That search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time: for which cause was this city destroyed.884 - Ezra 5:12     But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon.885 - Ezra 7:27     Blessed be the Lord God of our fathers, which hath put such a thing as this in the king's heart, to beautify the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem:886 - Ezra 8:1     These are now the chief of their fathers, and this is the genealogy of them that went up with me from Babylon, in the reign of Artaxerxes the king.887 - Ezra 8:28     And I said unto them, Ye are holy unto the Lord; the vessels are holy also; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering unto the Lord God of your fathers.888 - Ezra 8:29     Watch ye, and keep them, until ye weigh them before the chief of the priests and the Levites, and chief of the fathers of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the Lord.889 - Ezra 9:7     Since the days of our fathers have we been in a great trespass unto this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, and our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to a spoil, and to confusion of face, as it is this day.890 - Ezra 10:11     Now therefore make confession unto the Lord God of your fathers, and do his pleasure: and separate yourselves from the people of the land, and from the strange wives.891 - Ezra 10:16     And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest, with certain chief of the fathers, after the house of their fathers, and all of them by their names, were separated, and sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter.892 - Nehemiah 1:6     Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father's house have sinned.893 - Nehemiah 2:3     And said unto the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchres, lieth waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?894 - Nehemiah 2:5     And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy servant have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers' sepulchres, that I may build it.895 - Nehemiah 7:61     And these were they which went up also from Tel-melah, Tel-haresha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer: but they could not shew their father's house, nor their seed, whether they were of Israel.896 - Nehemiah 7:70     And some of the chief of the fathers gave unto the work.

They say unto him, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.1178 - Matthew 23:9     And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven.1179 - Matthew 23:30     And say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.1180 - Matthew 23:32     Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers.1181 - Matthew 24:36     But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.1182 - Matthew 25:34     Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:1183 - Matthew 26:29     But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.1184 - Matthew 26:39     And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.1185 - Matthew 26:42     He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.1186 - Matthew 26:53     Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?1187 - Matthew 28:19     Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:1188 - Mark 1:20     And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.1189 - Mark 5:40     And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying.1190 - Mark 7:10     For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death:1191 - Mark 7:11     But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; he shall be free.1192 - Mark 7:12     And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;1193 - Mark 8:38     Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.1194 - Mark 9:21     And he asked his father, How long is it ago since this came unto him? And he said, Of a child.1195 - Mark 9:24     And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.1196 - Mark 10:7     For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife;1197 - Mark 10:19     Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother.1198 - Mark 10:29     And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's,1199 - Mark 11:10     Blessed be the kingdom of our father David, that cometh in the name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest.1200 - Mark 11:25     And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.1201 - Mark 11:26     But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses.1202 - Mark 13:12     Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father the son; and children shall rise up against their parents, and shall cause them to be put to death.1203 - Mark 13:32     But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.1204 - Mark 14:36     And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt.1205 - Mark 15:21     And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.1206 - Luke 1:17     And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.1207 - Luke 1:32     He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:1208 - Luke 1:55     As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever.1209 - Luke 1:59     And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father.1210 - Luke 1:62     And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called.1211 - Luke 1:67     And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying,1212 - Luke 1:72     To perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant;1213 - Luke 1:73     The oath which he sware to our father Abraham,1214 - Luke 2:48     And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.1215 - Luke 2:49     And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?1216 - Luke 3:8     Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.1217 - Luke 6:23     Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward is great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets.1218 - Luke 6:26     Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets.1219 - Luke 6:36     Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.1220 - Luke 8:51     And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in, save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the maiden.1221 - Luke 9:26     For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels.1222 - Luke 9:42     And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare him.

But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.1239 - Luke 15:21     And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.1240 - Luke 15:22     But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet:1241 - Luke 15:27     And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound.1242 - Luke 15:28     And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father out, and entreated him.1243 - Luke 15:29     And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:1244 - Luke 16:24     And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.1245 - Luke 16:27     Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house:1246 - Luke 16:30     And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.1247 - Luke 18:20     Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.1248 - Luke 22:29     And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me;1249 - Luke 22:42     Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.1250 - Luke 23:34     Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.1251 - Luke 23:46     And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.1252 - Luke 24:49     And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.1253 - John 1:14     And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.1254 - John 1:18     No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.1255 - John 2:16     And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.1256 - John 3:35     The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.1257 - John 4:12     Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?1258 - John 4:20     Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.1259 - John 4:21     Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.1260 - John 4:23     But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.1261 - John 4:53     So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.1262 - John 5:17     But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.1263 - John 5:18     Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.1264 - John 5:19     Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.1265 - John 5:20     For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel.1266 - John 5:21     For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.1267 - John 5:22     For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son:1268 - John 5:23     That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him.1269 - John 5:26     For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;1270 - John 5:30     I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.1271 - John 5:36     But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.1272 - John 5:37     And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.1273 - John 5:43     I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.1274 - John 5:45     Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust.1275 - John 6:27     Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed.1276 - John 6:31     Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.1277 - John 6:32     Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven.1278 - John 6:37     All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.1279 - John 6:39     And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.1280 - John 6:42     And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven?1281 - John 6:44     No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.1282 - John 6:45     It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me.1283 - John 6:46     Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God, he hath seen the Father.1284 - John 6:49     Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.1285 - John 6:57     As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.1286 - John 6:58     This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever.1287 - John 6:65     And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father.1288 - John 7:22     Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man.1289 - John 8:16     And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.1290 - John 8:18     I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.1291 - John 8:19     Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.1292 - John 8:27     They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.1293 - John 8:28     Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.1294 - John 8:29     And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.1295 - John 8:38     I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.1296 - John 8:39     They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham.1297 - John 8:41     Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.1298 - John 8:42     Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.1299 - John 8:44     Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.1300 - John 8:49     Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.1301 - John 8:53     Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?1302 - John 8:54     Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:1303 - John 8:56     Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.1304 - John 10:15     As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.1305 - John 10:17     Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.1306 - John 10:18     No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.1307 - John 10:25     Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me.1308 - John 10:29     My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.1309 - John 10:30     I and my Father are one.1310 - John 10:32     Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?1311 - John 10:36     Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?1312 - John 10:37     If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.1313 - John 10:38     But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him.1314 - John 11:41     Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.1315 - John 12:26     If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour.1316 - John 12:27     Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.1317 - John 12:28     Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.1318 - John 12:49     For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.1319 - John 12:50     And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.1320 - John 13:1     Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end.1321 - John 13:3     Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God;1322 - John 14:2     In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.1323 - John 14:6     Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.1324 - John 14:7     If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.1325 - John 14:8     Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us.1326 - John 14:9     Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father?1327 - John 14:10     Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.1328 - John 14:11     Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works' sake.1329 - John 14:12     Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.1330 - John 14:13     And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.1331 - John 14:16     And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;1332 - John 14:20     At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.1333 - John 14:21     He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.1334 - John 14:23     Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.1335 - John 14:24     He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me.1336 - John 14:26     But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.1337 - John 14:28     Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I.1338 - John 14:31     But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence.1339 - John 15:1     I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.1340 - John 15:8     Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.1341 - John 15:9     As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love.1342 - John 15:10     If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.1343 - John 15:15     Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.1344 - John 15:16     Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.1345 - John 15:23     He that hateth me hateth my Father also.1346 - John 15:24     If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.1347 - John 15:26     But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me:1348 - John 16:3     And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me.1349 - John 16:10     Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more;1350 - John 16:15     All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you.1351 - John 16:16     A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.1352 - John 16:17     Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?1353 - John 16:23     And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.1354 - John 16:25     These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father.1355 - John 16:26     At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you:1356 - John 16:27     For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.1357 - John 16:28     I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.1358 - John 16:32     Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.1359 - John 17:1     These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee:1360 - John 17:5     And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.1361 - John 17:11     And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee.
