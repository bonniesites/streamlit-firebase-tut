### PRICING A WEBSITE JOB

For example, for a WordPress site development project, the typical stages include:

Planning
Implementation
Testing
Review
Client training
Content upload
Soft launch (and launch)
Post-launch support and maintenance
If we had to apply the bottom-up estimating technique to this, we’d further break down these stages into the actual tasks for each.

At the task level, here’s what this project could look like:

Planning

Plan IA
Sketch out a sitemap
Determine the technology stack
Understand the functionality to custom code
Understand the functionality to prove via plugins (with or without the customization)
Implementation

Build the website
Install and fine-tune plugins
Testing

Check overall functionality
Check for broken links
Check sitemap
Check for access
Check performance metrics
Review

Showing the site to the client
Do one round of revision
Submit for re-review
Client Training

Show the client the way around the site
Explain updates and ways of uploading content
And so on.

Step #2: Determine how long each of these tasks will take

don’t go with your first estimate. Consider these three things:

The best-case estimate (a)
The most likely estimate (m)
The worst-case estimate (b)
And your final estimate (E) becomes: (a + m + b) / 3.

Remember: tasks will always take longer than you think!

To find this out, use a time tracking tool. Toggl is a great option to consider.

It has apps for all major platforms, so you can track time even when you’re working locally. You can also set Toggl to launch when you start your laptop.

This way, you won’t forget to log your work hours. Also, with unlimited clients and projects, Toggl’s free plan will cover you fully.

(SUM OF ESTIMATE-HOURS) * (HOURLY RATE)


A few WordPress developers don’t like this method of estimating. They recommend offering a flat rate for a project based on factors like:

The ROI the client will get from hiring your services – For instance, how hiring you will get the client an additional $XX each month).

The market or niche of the client – For example, “adjusting” the cost based on the client by considering if the client is a solopreneur or a C-level executive in a top company. 

Essentially, the same service will be quoted at two prices.


Availability – This means charging higher if you’re booked out, occasionally discounting if in need of work).


“If the project doesn’t call for any special skills, I’ll bid it at $50 per hour. But if it will require 3d or video, or some kind of custom javascript, then I’ll charge between $75 and $100 per hour. I also consider who the client is, what they can afford, and how annoying they might be to deal with.” WPMU DEV Member – Kahnfusion

“Here’s how I sell my projects: I am quoting your website project at $6,000. I quote my projects in lump sum costs because I’m meticulous and regularly spend over 100 hours when building a website, making sure all details are accounted for. At my hourly rate of $100, it just wouldn’t be very fair to you to charge by the hour, which is why I’m quoting a lump sum cost for the website. Any additional extras or customization you’d like to do afterward will be charged hourly. This way, I just told them I am potentially going to spend 100 hours on their project, and at an hourly rate of $100 that’s a $10,000 value they’re getting for a lump sum of $6,000. Hopefully, they see the value in this, and it also prepares them to pay $100/hour for extras going forward.” WPMU DEV Member – Phil

A good rule of thumb is to get a good estimation of your client’s needs. Get as many details as possible before starting the project. Narrow down your quote and include a general time estimate on your website.
